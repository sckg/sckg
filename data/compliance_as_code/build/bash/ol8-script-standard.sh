# Bash remediation role for profile standard
# Profile Title:  Standard System Security Profile for Oracle Linux 8
# Profile Description:
# This profile contains rules to ensure standard security baseline
# of Oracle Linux 8 system. Regardless of your system's workload
# all of these checks should pass.
#
# Benchmark ID:  OL-8
# Benchmark Version:  0.1.50
#
# XCCDF Version:  1.1
#
# This file was generated by OpenSCAP 1.2.17 using:
# 	$ oscap xccdf generate fix --profile standard --template urn:xccdf:fix:script:sh xccdf-file.xml 
#
# This script is generated from an OpenSCAP profile without preliminary evaluation.
# It attempts to fix every selected rule, even if the system is already compliant.
#
# How to apply this remediation role:
# $ sudo ./remediation-role.sh

# package. It will combine multiple system calls belonging to the same
# syscall group into one audit rule (rather than to create audit rule per
# different system call) to avoid audit infrastructure performance penalty
# in the case of 'one-audit-rule-definition-per-one-system-call'. See:

# * audit rules' pattern		audit rule skeleton for same syscall

# 					with other rules from the same group
