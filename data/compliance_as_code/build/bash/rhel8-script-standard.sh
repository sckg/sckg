# Bash remediation role for profile standard
# Profile Title:  Standard System Security Profile for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8
# Profile Description:
# This profile contains rules to ensure standard security baseline
# of a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 system. Regardless of your system's workload
# all of these checks should pass.
#
# Benchmark ID:  RHEL-8
# Benchmark Version:  0.1.50
#
# XCCDF Version:  1.1
#
# This file was generated by OpenSCAP 1.2.17 using:
# 	$ oscap xccdf generate fix --profile standard --template urn:xccdf:fix:script:sh xccdf-file.xml 
#
# This script is generated from an OpenSCAP profile without preliminary evaluation.
# It attempts to fix every selected rule, even if the system is already compliant.
#
# How to apply this remediation role:
# $ sudo ./remediation-role.sh

# Function to fix syscall audit rule for given system call. It is
# based on example audit syscall rule definitions as outlined in
# /usr/share/doc/audit-2.3.7/stig.rules file provided with the audit
# package. It will combine multiple system calls belonging to the same
# syscall group into one audit rule (rather than to create audit rule per
# different system call) to avoid audit infrastructure performance penalty
# in the case of 'one-audit-rule-definition-per-one-system-call'. See:
#
#   https://www.redhat.com/archives/linux-audit/2014-November/msg00009.html
#
# for further details.

# Expects five arguments (each of them is required) in the form of:
# * audit tool				tool used to load audit rules,
# 					either 'auditctl', or 'augenrules
# * audit rules' pattern		audit rule skeleton for same syscall
# * syscall group			greatest common string this rule shares
# 					with other rules from the same group
# * architecture			architecture this rule is intended for
# * full form of new rule to add	expected full form of audit rule as to be
# 					added into audit.rules file
#
# Note: The 2-th up to 4-th arguments are used to determine how many existing
# audit rules will be inspected for resemblance with the new audit rule
# (5-th argument) the function is going to add. The rule's similarity check
# is performed to optimize audit.rules definition (merge syscalls of the same
# group into one rule) to avoid the "single-syscall-per-audit-rule" performance
# penalty.
