# Bash remediation role for profile ospp
# Profile Title:  OSPP - Protection Profile for General Purpose Operating Systems
# Profile Description:
# This profile reflects mandatory configuration controls identified in the
# NIAP Configuration Annex to the Protection Profile for General Purpose
# Operating Systems (Protection Profile Version 4.2).
# 
# As Fedora OS is moving target, this profile does not guarantee to provide
# security levels required from US National Security Systems. Main goal of
# the profile is to provide Fedora developers with hardened environment
# similar to the one mandated by US National Security Systems.
#
# Benchmark ID:  FEDORA
# Benchmark Version:  0.1.50
#
# XCCDF Version:  1.1
#
# This file was generated by OpenSCAP 1.2.17 using:
# 	$ oscap xccdf generate fix --profile ospp --template urn:xccdf:fix:script:sh xccdf-file.xml 
#
# This script is generated from an OpenSCAP profile without preliminary evaluation.
# It attempts to fix every selected rule, even if the system is already compliant.
#
# How to apply this remediation role:
# $ sudo ./remediation-role.sh

# different system call) to avoid audit infrastructure performance penalty
# in the case of 'one-audit-rule-definition-per-one-system-call'. See:

# 					either 'auditctl', or 'augenrules
# * audit rules' pattern		audit rule skeleton for same syscall

# 					with other rules from the same group
# * architecture			architecture this rule is intended for
# * full form of new rule to add	expected full form of audit rule as to be
