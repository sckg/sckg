5								SECURITY REQUIREMENTS This section of the CC SRG defines the security requirements for DoD’s use of cloud computing. It covers several areas as follows: • Security requirements for assessing CSOs for the award of a DoD PA and inclusion in the DoD Cloud Service Catalog. • Security requirements for CSP’s/CSOs while hosting DoD missions. • Security requirements for mission owner’s systems/applications using or built on CSOs. NOTICE: All CSP and CSO requirements in this CC SRG apply to all CSPs and CSOs offered to or contracted by the DoD. DoD recognizes that CSOs may be offered by a CSP or an integrator as the prime contractor on a DoD contract. DoD also recognizes that prime contractors may subcontract for multiple CSOs to meet contract capabilities requirements and may subcontract systems maintenance. Therefore, all requirements in this CC SRG apply to all CSOs provided by prime contractors and their subcontractors to include systems maintenance contractors who may have access to CSP customer information or who may have the capability of affecting the security of the CSO. This flow down to subcontractors is also covered in cloud and contractor associated DFARS clauses.		
5.1								DoD Policy Regarding Security Controls DoDI 8500.01 and DoDI 8510.01 require all DoD information systems to be categorized in accordance with CNSSI 1253 and implement a corresponding set of security controls and control enhancements (C/CEs) that are published in NIST SP 800-53, regardless of whether they are National Security Systems (NSS) or non-NSS. DoDI 8500.01, March 14, 2014 2.g(1) (1) All DoD IS and PIT systems will be categorized in accordance with Reference (ci) and will implement a corresponding set of security controls that are published in Reference (cj) regardless of whether they are National Security System (NSS) or non-NSS. (ci) Committee on National Security Systems Instruction 1253, “Security Categorization and Control Selection for National Security Systems,” March 15, 2012, as amended (cj) National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publication 800-53, “Recommended Security Controls for Federal Information Systems and Organizations,” current edition DoDI 8510.01, March 12, 2014 3. d. All DoD IS and PIT systems must be categorized in accordance with Committee on National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) 1253 (Reference (e)), implement a corresponding set of security controls from NIST SP 800-53 (Reference (f)), and use assessment procedures from NIST SP 800-53A (Reference (g)) and DoD-specific assignment values, overlays, implementation guidance, and assessment procedures found on the Knowledge Service (KS). As supporting reference security control documents are updated, DoD’s implementation of these updates will be coordinated through the RMF TAG. Note: “implement a corresponding set of security controls” means as defined by the corresponding 1253 aggregate baseline. The CNSSI 1253 baselines are tailored from the NIST SP 800-53 recommended baselines, as are the FedRAMP baselines. These baselines are a starting point for securing all DoD systems, which can be tailored further to address specific systems and situations. Refer to NIST SP 800-59, Guideline for Identifying an Information System as a National Security System, 29 for a definition of NSS and further information.		
5.1.1								DoD Use of FedRAMP Security Controls The FedRAMP low, moderate and high baselines are a tailored set of C/CEs based on the low, moderate and high baselines recommended in NIST SP 800-53 catalog of security controls. The 15 December 2014 DoD CIO memo regarding Updated Guidance on the Acquisition and Use of Commercial Cloud Computing Services states “FedRAMP will serve as the minimum security baseline for all DoD cloud services.” This SRG uses the FedRAMP moderate baseline at all information ILs and considers the high Baseline at some.		
5.1.1-Impact_level_2								The 2014 DoD CIO memo further states “components may host unclassified DoD information that has been publicly released on FedRAMP approved cloud services”. Using the definitions defined in Section 3.2, IL2 information may be hosted in a CSP that minimally holds a FedRAMP moderate or high PA; subject to compliance with the personnel security requirements outlined in Section 5.6.2, CSP Personnel Requirements and acceptance by the mission owner and the responsible AO. Only FedRAMP moderate or high baseline controls will be assessed for DoD PAs for IL2. DoD provides full reciprocity with FedRAMP moderate and high P-ATOs for DoD IL2. This in no way alleviates the CSP from meeting other security and integration requirements for CSP’s/CSOs as required by the mission owner while hosting DoD IT missions or the mission owner from securing their systems/websites/applications in IL2 CSOs.		
5.1.1-Impact_level_4								The FedRAMP moderate baseline, supplemented with DoD FedRAMP+ C/CEs and other requirements in this SRG, are used to assess CSPs toward awarding a DoD PA at information IL4. An alternate path to a DoD IL4 PA is available due to coordination of the FedRAMP high baseline and DoD IL4 FedRAMP+ C/CE. A FedRAMP high PA will be accepted for a DoD Level 4 PA without additional C/CE assessment, however, assessment of non-C/CE based requirements in this SRG is required.		
5.1.1-Impact_levels_56								The FedRAMP moderate or high baseline, supplemented with DoD FedRAMP+ C/CEs and requirements in this SRG, are used to assess CSPs toward awarding a DoD PA at information IL56. No matter what C/CE baseline is used as the basis for a FedRAMP PA, additional considerations and/or requirements will need to be assessed and approved before a DoD PA can be awarded at IL4/5/6. These considerations and/or requirements can be found throughout this SRG, while a summary can be found in Section 5.1.7, Additional Considerations and/or Requirements for IL4/5 DoD PA Award.		
5.1.2								DoD FedRAMP+ Security Controls/Enhancements DoD FedRAMP+ refers to a tailored baseline of security C/CEs which has been developed for each DoD information IL, except for IL2. These baselines incorporate, but are not limited to, the FedRAMP moderate or high baselines. The FedRAMP+ C/CEs include NIST 800-53 security controls and enhancements not included in the FedRAMP moderate baseline. FedRAMP+ also includes tailored values and selections for most FedRAMP and FedRAMP+ C/CEs which require definition. The FedRAMP+ C/CEs were selected primarily because they address issues such as the advanced persistent threat (APT) and/or insider threat, and because the DoD, unlike the rest of the federal government, must categorize its systems in accordance with CNSSI 1253, use its baselines, and then tailor as needed. The CNSSI 1253 baseline used in support of DoD PAs is based on moderate confidentiality and moderate integrity. It does not include a baseline for availability (categorization designated as MM-x). Availability is addressed in the FedRAMP baseline and may also be addressed by the mission owner in the contract/SLA. The resulting M-M-x baseline was compared to the FedRAMP moderate baseline to derive a tailored set of FedRAMP+ security controls/enhancements for each IL. This comparison indicated that the FedRAMP moderate baseline includes approximately 32 C/CEs that are also contained in the CNSSI 1253 M-M-x baseline, but not in the NIST 800-53 moderate baseline incorporated in both. The comparison also indicated that eighty-eight (88) of the C/CEs in the CNSSI 1253 M-M-x baseline are not in the FedRAMP moderate baseline. These 88 were analyzed for their security benefit in the CSP environment and projected cost if the CSP were required to implement the C/CE. Approximately half were selected for the DoD cloud baselines for assessing CSPs. The number of control enhancements selected varies by IL. More recently, with the development of the FedRAMP high baseline, a portion of the DoD IL4 FedRAMP+ C/CE was accepted for inclusion into the FedRAMP high baseline along with several value adjustments. Table 5-1 provides a listing of the FedRAMP+ C/CEs applicable to each information IL, which includes only three additional base controls. The rest are control enhancements. This table does not include controls added by the classified information or privacy overlays. More information on the assessment of the C/CE in these overlays is provided in the sections following this one. Note: This table does not include the FedRAMP moderate or high baseline C/CEs, tables of which can be obtained from the FedRAMP website on the documents page30.		
5.1.3								Parameter Values for Security Controls and Enhancements Both FedRAMP and the DoD have defined minimum requirements in security controls and enhancement parameters. However, in some circumstances, the specifics of the implementation are left to the CSP and assessed as to whether the implementation is appropriate for the CSO and government. For those controls required by FedRAMP and the DoD, the parameter values are defined in Appendix D - CSP Assessment Parameter Values for PA. Also see Section 5.1.5.2, Effects of the Privacy Overlay on CSPs and Mission Owners for additional parameter guidance.		
5.1.4								National Security Systems (NSS) Although the control baselines for all ILs are based on those from CNSSI 1253, only impact ILs5/6 are designed to accommodate NSS categorized up to M-M-x. NSS-specific C/CEs have been included at these levels along with those required for the slightly higher impact of these systems at the moderate level (short of a full high baseline). Thus, unclassified NSS must be instantiated at Level 5 if a CSO is used. This, however, does not preclude an unclassified nonNSS from operating at Level 5 if the mission/information owner requires the added security.		
5.1.4.1								NSS Level 6 Classified Overlay Applicability Impact level 6 is for classified systems which by definition are NSS. As such and IAW the DoD RMF, all CSOs are subject to the CNSSI 1253 Classified Information Overlay in addition to FedRAMP and FedRAMP+. This overlay is an attachment to Appendix F of the CNSSI 1253 entitled CNSSI 1253F, Attachment 5, Classified Information Overlay. 31 It is available from the CNSS library on the instructions page. This overlay imposes 94 additional C/CEs which must be assessed for a CSP’s CSO Level 6 PA. For all CSOs, there may only be a portion of these C/CEs applicable to the CSP with the balance of the C/CEs being fulfilled by the mission owner. This division of responsibility will be addressed in a future release of this document or in a companion document.		
5.1.5								Personally Identifiable Information (PII)/Protected Health Information (PHI) in the Cloud Personally Identifiable Information (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI) are categorized as CUI and, as such, PHI and most PII in the cloud must minimally be protected in a Level 4 CSO. Most PII refers to PII categorized as having a moderate or high (and some low not meeting the exception below) confidentiality impact level as determined in accordance with NIST SP 800-122 Guide to Protecting the Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable Information (PII)32. Mission owner PII impact level determinations will be performed as part of the information system’s privacy impact assessment per DoD Instruction 5400.16, “DoD Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Guidance”,33 and documented in Section 2.b. of DD Form 2930 “Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)34. This determination will take into account all relevant factors as presented in Section 3.2 of NIST SP 800-122 and guidance for assessing the risk of harm to individuals potentially affected by a breach in Section E of OMB Memo 17-12, “Preparing for and Responding to a Breach of Personally Identifiable Information"35. Mission Owners will publish, collect, process and store all sensitivity levels of PII in coordination with, and with the approval of, their DoD component’s senior privacy officer or their delegate. 		
5.1.5.1								PII at Level 2 There is a need for some low-confidentiality impact (low sensitivity) PII to be published or collected in commercial CSOs having a Level 2 PA. DoD CIO memo dated 07 August 2019, “Treatment of PII within Level 2 Commercial CSOs for DoD” states that “Level 2 will be the minimum cybersecurity requirement for DoD systems/applications containing low confidentiality impact level PII as determined in accordance with NIST SP 800-122”. Note: A DoD information impact level 2 PA is based on the FedRAMP moderate baseline, thus PII at Level 2 will be protected at the moderate level IAW 32 CFR 2002 Controlled Unclassified Information36. The following requirements are provided for low PII published, collected, stored or processed in commercial CSOs: • Mission owners will only publish, collect, store and process low confidentiality impact (sensitivity) PII in a CSO minimally possessing a FedRAMP Moderate P-ATO listed on the FedRAMP Marketplace and a DoD Level 2 PA, with privacy officer approval. • Mission owner PII impact level determination will consider all relevant factors together; one factor by itself might indicate a low impact level, but another factor might indicate a high impact level, and thus override the first factor. • Prior to authorizing the system, the AO is accountable to review the PIA and ensure that appropriate cyber assessments are performed per DoDI 8510.01 and the CC SRG, and that required CSSP cybersecurity support services are provided per DoDI 8530.01. • Low impact/sensitivity PII, when published or collected in a CSO with a Level 2 PA, must be minimally protected in accordance with NIST SP 800-122 and privacy laws as supported by a FedRAMP Moderate P-ATO, and the low PII overlay of the privacy overlay (see Section 5.1.5.2, CNSSI 1253 Privacy Overlay). Note: Authentication and identification information of privileged users required for the configuration, operation and maintenance of the IL2 CSO and mission owner’s application is exempt from the above requirements providing it is protected as all such information is customarily protected.		
5.1.5.2								CNSSI 1253 Privacy Overlay The CNSSI 1253 Privacy Overlay is an attachment to Appendix F of the CNSSI 1253 entitled CNSSI 1253F, Attachment 6, Privacy Overlay. 37 It is available from the CNSS library on the instructions page. The privacy overlay was developed in accordance with federal privacy requirements found in laws, policies and standards that apply to government agencies, such as the Privacy Act of 1974 38and HIPAA39, leveraging experts and lawyers in both fields. Legal references are included as the basis for all control specifications in the privacy overlay, including whether to select or exclude C/CE as well as the provision of supplemental guidance and control extensions. It is supported by DoD and the IC as well as other federal agencies that are part of the CNSS. The privacy overlay was written by CNSS to protect PII and PHI in NSS, however, many of the requirements on which the overlay specifications are based apply to any federal information system that contains PII or PHI, regardless of whether the system is an NSS or not. All federal agencies including DoD must comply with public laws that apply to the federal government’s collection, use, and maintenance of PII; thus, DoD invokes the CNSS privacy overlay since it is one of the best DoD resources on the subject. This overlay addresses low, moderate and high sensitivity PII and PHI by providing an overlay for each. It invokes most of the 36 privacy-specific C/CEs from NIST SP 800-53 rev4, Appendix J, Privacy Control Catalog and invokes additional C/CEs from the Security Control Catalog. It also modifies many of the already selected C/CEs in the FedRAMP moderate and FedRAMP+ baselines by providing supplemental guidance along with parameter value changes and control extensions. Quantities of additional C/CEs and guidance depend on both the PII sensitivity level and whether the PII meets the definition of PHI. The CNSSI 1253 Privacy Overlay is applicable to all systems and CSOs that process or store PII/PHI for the DoD. The appropriate overlay (L, M, H, PHI) will be applied based on the confidentiality impact determination in the PIA. Mission owners wishing to process or store PII or PHI in a commercial or private CSO must apply the privacy overlay by including the CSO applicable requirements in their contracts and validate compliance for their ATO. 		
5.1.5.3								Effects of the Privacy Overlay on CSPs and Mission Owners To limit the affect the listing of privacy overlay C/CE and their parameter values on the size of the main portion of the CC SRG, this section provides pointers to tables in Appendix E of privacy overlay C/CE in the following categories: • FedRAMP moderate and FedRAMP+ C/CE that are modified through control extensions or altered via implementation guidance or value specifications. These tables also include C/CE that are required by law or regulation: o Table E-1 – FedRAMP M C/CE Modified or Required by Regulation o Table E-2– FedRAMP+ C/CE Modified or Required by Regulation • C/CE not included in the DoD cloud baseline which includes FedRAMP moderate and FedRAMP+ C/CE. This includes some C/CE designated as SLA C/CE as shown in Section 5.1.6, Security Controls/Enhancements to be optionally addressed in the Contract/SLA and some CNSSI 1253 C/CE that were not selected for inclusion in the FedRAMP+ or SLA C/CE sets: o Table E-3 – Privacy Overlay C/CE Not Included In FedRAMP M or FedRAMP+ • C/CE that are in the FedRAMP Moderate and FedRAMP+ C/CE baselines that have parameter values defined by the overlay which may modify the parameter values defined in Table D-1: FedRAMP+ Control/Enhancement Parameter Values for PA Assessment o Table E-4 – PII/PHI Parameter Values for FedRAMP and FedRAMP+ C/CE • C/CE not included in the DoD cloud baseline which includes FedRAMP Moderate and FedRAMP+ C/CE that have parameter values defined by the overlay. o Table E-5 – PII/PHI Parameter Values for C/CE Not Included In FedRAMP M or FedRAMP+ Note: A comparative analysis of the Privacy Overlay C/CE to various other baselines is provided in Appendix F. This comparison provides statistics or counts of C/CE in various categories. This is provided for informational purposes only and may be removed from the final document or a future release of the CC SRG.		
5.1.5.4								CSO Assessment of Privacy Overlay Control/Control Enhancements DISA is not assessing CSOs for privacy. Mission owners are responsible for privacy overlay assessments of the P/SaaS CSOs used and any applications built on I/PaaS.		
5.1.6								Security Controls/Enhancements To Be Optionally Addressed in the Contract/SLA Table 5-1 shows the C/CEs designated for potential inclusion in a mission owner’s contract or service level agreement (SLA) with the CSP if the mission owner feels they need the added security/capability afforded by the C/CE. This is essentially a tailoring in decision for the mission owner to optionally address in the contract or SLA, over and above the FedRAMP and FedRAMP+ C/CEs which must be included by default. The SLA C/CE are CNSSI 1253 MMx C/CE that were not selected as being required as part of the FedRAMP+ C/CE set(s), however, the FedRAMP+ selection working group felt the C/CE had value if the mission owner wanted to add them to their contract. Additionally, it is the mission owner’s responsibility to define any parameter values associated with any added C/CE. Typically, these values would be based on DoD RMF TAG values or CNSSI 1253 values as shown in Table D-2. While these C/CEs generally address system availability, they apply to the availability of information related to continuous monitoring, incident response and other security issues. It must be noted that this listing does not preclude the mission owner from addressing any control or enhancement from any CNSSI 1253 baseline or the NIST SP 800-53 rev4 in the contract/SLA if they need to tailor in the control/enhancement to be provided/met by the CSP to secure their system or application. Assessment and continuous monitoring of compliance with these C/CEs is the responsibility of the mission owner as negotiated with the CSP in attaining and maintaining the mission’s ATO. These C/CEs are not assessed toward the award of a DoD PA at this time.		
5.1.7								Additional Considerations and/or Requirements for L4/5 DoD PA Award The following is a list of considerations and/or requirements that must be assessed or reviewed in addition to or in conjunction with the security control assessments for AO acceptance before a Level 4/5/6 PA will be awarded. The listing may not be all-inclusive, and specific requirements may not have been fully developed at this time. The considerations and/or requirements that DoD will assess include, but are not limited to, the following: • How support for DoD PKI authentication by DoD privileged and non-privileged users is implemented. This is to include the processes and protocols used along with their implementation. o Related CC SRG sections:  5.4, CSP use of DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and subsections.  5.10.7, Active Directory Integration for Cloud and subsections. • How support for DoD IP addressing will be implemented. o Related CC SRG section:  5.10.4.1, IP Addressing. This consideration addresses any need to route commercial IP addresses across the NIPRNet • CSP Data center locations hosting the CSO for which the PA is to be awarded. o Related CC SRG section:  5.2.1, Jurisdiction/Location Requirements • CSO management/monitoring plane (and/or specific devices/systems) and its integration with the CSP’s corporate network or the general commercial CSO management plane. Note: No specifics are provided regarding this consideration at this time; however, see the next item for related concerns. o Related CC SRG section:  5.10.2.3, Management Plane Connectivity • CSP personnel managing and/or monitoring the CSO infrastructure. This is primarily related to U.S. persons constraints in regard to the previous item. o Related CC SRG section:  5.6.2, CSP Personnel Requirements. • The availability of a private connection capability between the off-premises CSP’s/CSO’s network and DoD networks in support of connections through the boundary cloud access point (BCAP) and meet-me points. o Related CC SRG section:  5.10.1, Cloud Access Point (CAP) and subsections.  5.10.1.1.2, NIPRNet BCAP Meet-Me Points  5.10.1.1.3, CSP Support for BCAP Connectivity • Reliance of the CSO or user experience on internet-based capabilities such as the public DNS or content delivery networks. All such capabilities must be available via the CSO infrastructure and the connections to it via the DISN BCAPs. The CSO must be able to function if DoD limits access to or disconnects from the internet in times of conflict or when the DISN/DODIN is being attacked. Note: No specific requirements other than those noted here are provided. o Related CC SRG section:  5.10.4.2, Domain Name Services (DNS). • Reliance on internet access to reach the CSO management/service-ordering portal or API endpoints from either NIPRNet or from within the CSO. All such access must be via the CAP if from the NIPRNet or must remain on the CSP’s/CSO’s network if from within the CSO. These requirements must be minimally configurable if not inherent. Note: No specific requirements other than those noted here are provided. o Related CC SRG section:  5.10.1, Cloud Access Point (CAP) and subsections. • The protections in place in the CSP’s network and CSO to prevent any internet connection to the CSP’s/CSO’s network and CSO from becoming a back door to the NIPRNet via the private connection through the BCAP. o Related CC SRG section:  5.10.1.1.4, CSP/CSO Network Connectivity to internet and BCAP. • The robustness of the CSP’s required boundary protection (defense-in-depth security/protective measures) implemented between the internet and the CSO for its protection from internet-based threats. This protection is expected to be different depending on whether the CSO is I/PaaS or P/SaaS and whether the Mission Owner has control over their portion of the CSO. o Related CC SRG section:  5.10.3, CSP Service Architecture and subsections. • All other requirements as defined in the rest of this SRG • Other considerations as realized while assessing the CSO or as a result of lessons learned.  		
5.2								Legal Considerations This section deals with legal requirements revolving around the location of DoD information as well as who may have access to it in CSP facilities and CSOs.		
5.2.1								Jurisdiction/Location Requirements Legal jurisdiction over information controls where DoD and U.S. government data can be processed/stored. This is nuanced by the information being on DoD premises. To protect against seizure and improper use by non-U.S. persons and government entities, all data stored and processed by/for the DoD must reside in a facility under the exclusive legal jurisdiction of the U.S. This may include DoD bases on foreign soil depending upon Status of Forces Agreements (SOFAs). CSPs will maintain all government data, that is not physically located on DoD premises, within the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas of the U.S. (as defined at FAR 2.10140), unless otherwise authorized by the responsible AO as described in DoDI 8510.01. The contracting officer shall provide written notification to the contractor when the contractor is permitted to maintain government data at a location outside the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and outlying areas of the United States. CSPs will provide the agency a list of the physical locations where the data could be stored at any given time and update that list as new physical locations are added. Additionally, the mission owner and/or contracting officer must review CSP terms and conditions to ensure data stored and processed in U.S. datacenters does not fall under the legal jurisdiction of another country. On-premises CSOs implemented by a DoD or non-DoD CSP which uses a hybrid model employing off-premises CSPs and CSOs to augment the on-premises CSO or by virtually extending the DoD fence-line (DISN boundary) must also meet the location requirements stated here. Note: An exception is made for content delivery networks (CDN) in which non-sensitive DoD data may be cached anywhere in the world. However, when sensitive information is requested through a CDN, the request must be sent back to its storage facility under U.S. jurisdiction for retrieval. Corresponding Security Controls: SA-9(5) 	SA-9 (5)	
5.2.1.1								DoD Off-Premises vs. On-Premises vs. Virtually On-Premises DoD on-premises vs. off-premises relates to the physical or virtual location of a facility or IT infrastructure.		
5.2.1.1-DoD_off-premises								A facility (building/container) or IT infrastructure is off-premises if it is NOT physically or virtually on DoD owned or controlled property (i.e., on-premises). Refer to DoD on-premises and DoD virtually on-premises below.		
5.2.1.1-DoD_on-premises								A facility (building/container) or IT infrastructure is on-premises if it is physically on DoD owned or controlled property. That is, it is within the protected perimeter (walls or “fence line”) of a DoD installation (i.e., base, camp, post, or station (B/C/P/S) or leased commercial space) which is under the direct control of DoD personnel and DoD security policies. DoD on-premises includes DoD data centers, other facilities located on a DoD B/C/P/S, or in a commercial or other government facility (or portions thereof) under the direct control of DoD personnel and DoD security policies. A commercial facility, in this sense, means a building or space leased and controlled by DoD. Such facilities are considered to be within the protected perimeter or “fence line” of a DoD controlled installation or property. Physical facilities may be permanent buildings or portable structures such as transit/shipping containers. An example of the latter might be a shipping container housing a commercial CSP’s infrastructure located adjacent to a core data center and connected to its network as if it were inside the building. DoD CSPs will, and commercial CSPs may (under DoD contract), instantiate their CSO architecture on DoD premises (DoD on-premises). Interconnection with DoD networks will be interoperable IAW engineering requirements that meet cybersecurity guidance and controls. Such implementations will be considered DoD private.		
5.2.1.1-DoD_virtually_on-premises								A DoD private IT and/or CSO infrastructure located in a physically off-premises location (facility) such as a federal government or commercial data center (i.e., facilities under the direct control of non-DoD personnel using non-DoD security policies) may be considered virtually on-premises under specific conditions as listed below. These conditions apply certain physical security controls and extend the DISN accreditation boundary. In essence this construct virtually extends the DoD protected perimeter or “fence line” around the infrastructure. It also places the IT/CSO infrastructure and its management plane in one or more DISN enclaves thus enabling alternative approaches for boundary protection such as using CSO provided infrastructure in lieu of a dedicated DoD ICAP/BCAP. An IT/CSO infrastructure may be considered virtually on-premises under the following conditions: • The CSO infrastructure is DoD private/community and its infrastructure, devices, monitoring/support infrastructure, and management plane are dedicated to it; physically separate from other infrastructure, devices, and network enclaves in the data center. • DISN transport is extended to the CSO’s network enclave(s) supporting the CSO infrastructure, CSO monitoring/support infrastructure, and CSO management plane. • Enclave/datacenter boundary protections are implemented to protect the CSO operational enclave(s) (which may include the CSO monitoring/support infrastructure) IAW DISN enclave boundary or core data center protection requirements. • The CSO infrastructure is managed from one or more enclave(s) dedicated to managing the CSO. This can be done using dedicated workstations in the enclave or remotely using dedicated virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI). • Enclave boundary protections are implemented to protect the dedicated CSO management/monitoring/support enclave(s) IAW DISN enclave boundary protection requirements. • The CSO infrastructure is housed in a physically separate/protected space such as a cage or room (or minimally one or more locked cabinets with closed non-removable sides closing the DoD space) within the commercial data center used to house the DISN network device(s) and CSO infrastructure. Related C/CE: PE-3, PE-3(1)*, PE-3 (4)*, PE4 • This physically separate space is minimally protected as follows: o Physical access to the data center is compliant with all required physical and maintenance personnel access security controls in the FedRAMP moderate or high baseline as appropriate to include but not limited to personnel role-based access control, access auditing, visitor access control and escorting as needed, etc. Related C/CE: MA-5, MA-5(1), PE-2, PE-2 (3)*, PE-3, PE-3(1)*, PE-6, PE-6(1). PE-6(4)*, PE-8, o Physical access to the DoD space is compliant with all required physical and maintenance personnel access security controls in the FedRAMP moderate baseline or high baseline as appropriate (as described above for the data center) and/or appropriate CNSSI 1253 baselines. NOTE: Additional or alternate physical security and personnel controls may be required for facilities housing classified systems. o Personnel access is controlled by an automated entry access control system (AECS) that is token and/or biometric based. This system may be under DoD control or under the control of the facility owner, but must limit access to only authorized individuals, must log/audit all accesses to include the identities of the personnel accessing and departing, and must provide and log alerts for unauthorized accesses and failed attempts. Related C/CE: PE-6, PE-6(1) and PE-6(4)* o Access to the physical space is externally monitored by the facility owner using video cameras and physical intrusion detection system (PIDS) (i.e., intrusion alarm system). Related C/CE: PE-6, PE-6(1), PE-6(3)*, and PE-6(4)* o It is highly recommended that the internal space be monitored by an automated motion activated PIDS and video cameras operated by DoD. In this manner DoD can monitor all physical activities within the space, authorized or unauthorized. Related C/CE: PE-6, PE-6(1), PE-6(2)*, PE-6(3)*, and PE-6(4)*	PE-6,PE-6 (1),PE-6 (2),PE-6 (3),PE-6 (4)	
5.2.2								Cloud Deployment Model Considerations/Separation Requirements The risks and legal considerations in using virtualization technologies further restrict the types of tenants that can obtain cloud services from a virtualized environment on the same physical infrastructure and the types of cloud deployment models (i.e., public, private, community, and hybrid) in which the various types of DoD information may be processed or stored. While shared cloud environments provide significant opportunities for DoD entities, they also present unique risks to DoD data and systems that must be addressed. These risks include exploitation of vulnerabilities in virtualization technologies, interfaces to external systems, APIs, and management systems. These have the potential for providing back door connections and CSP privileged user access to customer’s systems and data. While proper configuration of the virtual and physical environment can mitigate many of these threats, there is still residual risk that may or may not be acceptable to DoD. Legal concerns such as e-discovery and law enforcement seizure of non-government CSP customer/tenant’s data pose a threat to DoD data if it is in the same storage media. Due to these concerns, DoD is currently taking a cautious approach with regard to level 5 information. Infrastructure (as related to cloud services), is the physical hardware (i.e., servers and storage), and the network interconnecting the hardware that supports the cloud service and its virtualization technology (if used). This includes the systems and networks used by the CSP to manage the infrastructure. While the physical space in which this infrastructure is housed is part of the CSP’s infrastructure, this is not a factor in DoD’s separation restrictions except at level 6. Dedicated infrastructure (as related to cloud services) refers to the cloud service infrastructure being dedicated to serving a single customer organization or a specific group of customer organizations (a community). A private cloud service implements dedicated infrastructure to serve one customer organization or community. This SRG considers DoD as the organization which consists of all DoD components. This SRG restricts private cloud for DoD as meaning dedicated infrastructure that serves multiple DoD users and tenants and designates this as a DoD private cloud. DoD private clouds or cloud service offerings may be multi-tenant serving all or some DoD components (DoD community) or may be single tenant serving a single mission. A community cloud service implements dedicated infrastructure to serve a specific group or class of customer organizations. Since the definition of DoD private could also be considered a DoD community cloud, this SRG will use the term DoD private/community. This SRG will also use the term federal government community, meaning dedicated multi-tenant infrastructure that serves both DoD components and mission owners as well as other federal government agencies and their mission owners.

5.2.2.1								Impact Level 2 Location and Separation Requirements Impact level 2 cloud services can be offered on any of the four deployment models. Information that may be processed and stored at Impact Levels 2 can be processed on-premises or off-premises, as long as the physical location of the information is restricted as described in Section 5.2.1, Jurisdiction/Location Requirements. For a level 2 PA, at this time, DoD is accepting the risk that this is adequately covered by a FedRAMP moderate PA such that the requirement will not be additionally assessed for a level 2 PA.		
5.2.2.2								Impact Level 4 Location and Separation Requirements Impact level 4 cloud services can be offered on any of the four deployment models. Information that may be processed and stored at level 4 can be processed on-premises or off-premises, as long as the physical location of the information is restricted as described in Section 5.2.1, Jurisdiction/Location Requirements. For a level 4 PA, the CSP must provide evidence of strong virtual separation controls and monitoring in support of the ability to meet “search and seizure” requests for non-DoD information and data without the release of DoD information and data and vice-versa. Additionally, the strong virtual separation controls must prevent/mitigate/eliminate the potential vulnerability whereby one CSP customer using the same physical hardware as another CSP customer can gain access to the other’s information/data, virtual network, or virtual machines. Monitoring must detect such unauthorized accesses and/or attempts so that incident response can occur. 		
5.2.2.3								Impact Level 5 Location and Separation Requirements Information that must be processed and stored at impact level 5 can only be processed in a federal government community or DoD private/community cloud, on-premises or off-premises in any cloud deployment model that restricts the physical location of the information as described in Section 5.2.1, Jurisdiction/Location Requirements. The following also applies: • Only federal government community or DoD private/ clouds are eligible for impact level 5. • Each deployment model may support multiple missions or tenants/missions from each customer organization. • Virtual/logical separation between DoD and federal Government tenants/missions is sufficient. Virtual/logical separation between tenant/mission systems is minimally required. • Physical separation from non-DoD/non-federal government tenants (i.e., public, local/state government tenants) is required. Note: While multi-tenant CSOs marketed as ITAR compliant”, “government clouds”, or “clouds for government” might restrict data location to U.S. jurisdiction, and might restrict the personnel that manage the CSO, they do not necessarily meet the standard for “dedicated” to the federal government or DoD. If the cloud service, or the underlying infrastructure it resides on, hosts any non-federal U.S. government tenant, (such as state, local, or tribal governments, industry/academic partners, or foreign governments) it is considered a public cloud for purposes of this SRG. As such, while DoD sees this as adequate for level 4, this alleged attribute is not sufficient for CSP selection by DoD mission owners for level 5 missions. This restriction might be waived by DoD if the CSP and CSO can demonstrate sufficient separation between tenant’s workloads and data and/or the general government community and federal government community. 		
5.2.2.3.1								Impact Level 5 Separation in an Impact Level 4 CSO Sufficient separation of compute and storage for level 5 systems and data may be optionally achieved in a level 4 CSO under certain circumstances. CSPs may wish to offer a level 5 CSO in a larger level 4 CSO possessing a DoD PA. The level 5 CSO is based on a subset of services offered by or in addition to the level 4 CSO. The specific minimum requirements are as follows: • The supporting CSO must have a level 4 PA. A separate level 5 PA with conditions addressing the core services enabling the separation and approved supporting services will be developed. • Physical compute platforms must be dedicated to the mission owner’s system. o The CSO must offer one or more services that permit the mission owner to select dedicated compute platforms under their account. o The mission owner must select one or more of the dedicated platform services for their system’s account and operations. • All data related to the level 5 system must be encrypted at rest within the CSO and related CSOs. This includes DoD information processed, stored, or transmitted by the system, as well as the system’s virtual hard drives. o Encryption keys must be in the control of the mission owner with no or tightly restricted access by CSP personnel. Only the mission owner’s systems may be able to decrypt the data. o Encryption modules must be FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 validated and operated in FIPS Mode or implement other NSA approved cryptography. • NSA must evaluate and provide a risk assessment on any key management systems (KMS). CSOs supporting the cryptography requirements with a focus on cryptography operations and key management. Refer to Section 5.2.2.3.1.1 Cloud-Based KMS Security Requirements for minimum KMS security requirements and additional engagement information. This is in addition to 3PAO assessment of the overall Level 4 and 5 CSOs. Note: While the requirements here are primarily focused on an IaaS CSO, they are also applicable to PaaS and SaaS CSOs. Additional requirements may be necessary for these CSOs. CSPs having a Level 4 PA wishing to offer a CSO as described here should contact the DISA Cloud Support Office. DISA will engage NSA, and NSA will then establish a contractual arrangement with the CSO to affect the risk assessment. 		
5.2.2.3.2								Cloud-Based KMS Security Requirements This section addresses security requirements that a cloud-based KMS must satisfy for protecting IL5 information in an IL4-accredited cloud. NSA shall be responsible for evaluating a cloud-based encryption and KMS for use as a solution to protect IL5 information in an IL4-accredited cloud according to the following requirements: 1. The CSP shall protect IL5 information using cryptographic algorithms and key sizes selected from the Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) suite. Note: The Commercial National Security Algorithm (CNSA) replaced Suite-B in specifying NSA preferred algorithms and key sizes for protecting information up to Top Secret. 2. Cryptographic algorithms and protocols used in the cloud-based KMS shall be implemented according to applicable cryptographic standards. a. Cloud-based KMS components shall have been evaluated against and determined to be compliant with applicable National Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP) Protection Profiles. b. Cryptographic software modules used in cloud-based KMS shall have received FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 accreditation. c. Cryptographic hardware security modules used in cloud-based KMS shall have received FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 Level 3 accreditation. Note: FIPS 140-3 became effective on September 22, 2019. FIPS 140-3 testing will begin on September 22, 2020. Before September 22, 2020 cryptographic modules shall be evaluated against FIPS 140-2; September 22, 2020 and after cryptographic modules shall be evaluated against FIPS 140-3. 3. Cryptographic algorithms, protocols, and procedures used in cloud-based KMS shall be developed and maintained in accordance with a secure software development lifecycle process. Note: Recognizing that software will always tend to contain vulnerabilities, secure code lifecycle processes help to detect and remove vulnerabilities from code during and after development. 4. The DoD mission owner shall control the keys used to protect that mission’s information: a. The CSP shall provide secure methods for managing access to a mission’s keys and information. b. The CSP shall securely delete a mission owner’s keys on demand from the mission owner. i. If the CSP makes deleted keys recoverable by default, the CSP shall inform the mission owner how long a key will be in a recoverable state. ii. The CSP shall provide the mission owner with the ability to make keys unrecoverable when deleted. The mission owner shall accept the risk that the keys will no longer be available. Note: CSPs commonly make deleted keys recoverable for a short period of time in case the customer discovers that deleting a key was done by mistake. c. The CSP shall provide the customer with secure methods for importing keys into the cloud and for exporting keys from the cloud. 5. The CSP shall have security procedures in place to prevent CSP personnel from gaining access to customer keys: a. The CSP shall encrypt customer keys while at rest in the cloud. b. The CSP shall protect customer keys using secure channels when the keys are transmitted internally to the cloud system. c. The CSP shall minimize the exposure of customer keys while the keys are being actively used for cryptographic purposes. i. The CSP shall ensure only the cryptographic process required to use an unencrypted key shall have access to the key; ii. The CSP shall ensure an unencrypted key is not stored in memory longer than necessary. iii. The CSP shall ensure an unencrypted key is securely deleted from memory and disk when no longer needed. d. The CSP shall have processes in place to detect malicious administrators or other inside attacker activities. 6. The CSP shall ensure cryptographic processes that handle customer keys are securely separated from other processes. Note: Cryptographic processes are considered to be properly separated if they do not intermingle customers’ key material and a vulnerability in a key relevant process does not compromise the security of other customers’ keys.		
5.2.2.3.3								NSA Cloud-Based KMS Evaluation Methodology NSA will evaluate a cloud-based KMS against the security requirements detailed in this document by performing the following activities: 1. Engagement with the CSP to gain insight into details about the architecture and cryptographic services that are relevant and cannot be gained by public literature; 2. Analysis of the cloud-based KMS or documentation from the vendor regarding detailed operation of these services; 3. Security analysis of the web tier to assess security posture against web vulnerabilities, such as incorrectly implemented access controls, common web vulnerabilities, or other attacks that could be used to compromise an account. Enumeration of controls in place to defend against such attacks; 4. Analysis of the cloud architecture to determine how vulnerabilities in the architecture could allow malicious actors to gain access to DoD data or keys; 5. Confirmation that the cloud vendor has relevant government certifications, FIPS validations, and NIAP Protection Profiles. Direct platform testing shall be the preferred method for evaluating requirements, but vendor attestation shall be acceptable when direct platform testing is not feasible. Methods used to evaluate each requirement shall be documented and considered when developing a risk recommendation for the cloud-based KMS solution.		
5.2.2.3.4								Process of Requesting a Cloud-Based KMS Evaluation from NSA To request an evaluation of a cloud encryption and key management system, the DoD shall enter a Customer Service Request Portal (CSRP) request to NSA, specifically requesting this type of evaluation in support of the DoD CCSRG. The DoD shall direct the request to the Office of the National Manager (ONM), who will then task the appropriate NSA organizations in the Cybersecurity Directorate (C1 - Analysis and Mitigations and C2 - Encryption Production and Solutions) to perform the evaluation. The length of the evaluation shall be no shorter than three months. After the evaluation is complete, C1 and Y2 will produce documentation about the evaluation and provide a risk recommendation.		
5.2.2.4								Impact Level 6 Location and Separation Requirements Impact Level 6 is reserved for the storage and processing of information classified up to Secret. Information that must be processed and stored at impact level 6 can only be processed in a DoD private/community or federal government community cloud, on-premises or off-premises in any cloud deployment model that restricts the physical location of the information as described in Section 5.2.1, Jurisdiction/Location Requirements. The following applies: • Impact level 6 information up to the Secret level must be stored and processed in a dedicated cloud infrastructure located in facilities approved for the processing of classified information, rated at or above the highest level of classification of the information being stored and/or processed. • Impact level 6 CSO infrastructure is considered to be a SIPRNet enclave and as such will be a closed self-contained environment for the CSO processing, storage, and management planes only connected to SIPRNet. • Each deployment model may support multiple Secret missions from multiple customer organizations. • Virtual/logical separation between DoD and Federal Government tenants/Secret missions is sufficient. • Virtual/logical separation between tenant/mission systems is minimally required. • Physical separation from non-DoD/non-federal government tenants (i.e., public, local/state government tenants) is required.		
5.2.2.5								Separation in Support of Law Enforcement and Criminal Investigation and EDiscovery Under federal law, the federal government reserves the right for law enforcement officials to perform criminal investigations of federal government employees and elected officials as well as anyone with access to federal government information for misconduct, misuse of such data, or for incident investigation. Such criminal investigations may include a need for E-Discovery on federal government information to collect digital evidence. As such the CSP must be able to segregate federal government information from non-federal government information within the CSO. The granularity of separation must be at the federal government mission owner level. The CSP must also ensure this segregation requirement flows down to all CSP/integrator subcontracted CSP/CSOs. The CSP and subcontractors must then be capable, upon request of the contracting officer(s) or in response to a subpoena, of isolating one or more federal government mission owner’s data into an environment where it may be reviewed, scanned, or forensically evaluated in a secure space or via secure remote connection with access limited to authorized Government personnel identified by the contracting officer, and without the CSP’s involvement or provide a forensic digital image of the requested federal government information. Refer to Section 6.5.4, Digital Forensics in the Cloud and Support for Law Enforcement/Criminal Investigation for additional information on capturing and protecting forensic digital images.		
5.2.3								DoD Data Ownership and CSP Use of DoD Data All DoD information/data placed or created by DoD users in a CSP’s CSO is owned by the DoD, the mission owner, and/or their information owner unless otherwise stipulated in the CSP’s contract with the DoD. The CSP has no rights to the DoD’s information/data. DoD information/data includes logs and monitoring data created within and by a mission owner’s system/application implemented in IaaS/PaaS CSOs as well as logs created for and provided to the mission owner related to their usage and management of the CSO. DoD also maintains ownership of all information/data created by the CSP/CSO for DoD if such activities are part of the contract. CSPs seeking a DoD PA must agree that DoD remains the owner of all DoD data in a CSO. CSPs are prohibited from using DoD data in any way other than that required to provide contracted services to DoD (e.g., customer access/usage logs used for billing) This means that the CSP may not “data mine” DoD email, files, information in data bases, or communications for any purpose other than that stipulated in the contract. The CSP maintains ownership of all logs and monitoring data created within the CSO related to the mission owner’s usage and management of the CSO. This includes logs related to customer access and usage used for billing, data used for capacity planning for the CSO, monitoring data related to malicious activities or CSO health. This also includes all audit content specified by the AU-2 security control for the time period specified by AU-11. While the CSP retains ownership of this information, some or all must be shared with the mission owner for the purpose of planning, forensics, billing validation, retention, etc. The ownership of the copies of this information shared with the DoD/mission owner is maintained by the DoD/mission owner. Additionally, all DoD information/data and CSP information/data shared with the mission owner must be made available for off-boarding and backup IAW Sections 5.8, Data Retrieval and Destruction for Off-boarding from a CSO and 5.12 - Backup. Mission owners must address data ownership in the contract. Related Security Controls: AC-23	AC-23	
5.3								Ongoing Assessment Both FedRAMP and DoD require an ongoing assessment and authorization capability for CSOs providing services to the DoD. This capability is built upon the DoD RMF and the FedRAMP continuous monitoring strategy, as described in the Guide to Understanding FedRAMP 41and FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide. 42 These ongoing assessment processes which are discussed in the following sections include continuous monitoring and change control. Ongoing assessment processes do not differ by impact level, though the artifacts produced as part of those processes may. (e.g., Level 2 CSOs will have fewer controls to monitor than level 4 CSOs.) These processes will differ, however, based on whether or not CSOs are part of the FedRAMP catalog or have a FedRAMP JAB PA. These differences are based on the division of responsibility over the set of security controls and the ability of DoD to access the artifacts produced as part of the FedRAMP processes. Ongoing assessment responsibility mirrors the divided responsibilities and control inherent in cloud systems. FedRAMP’s processes will be leveraged for all CSOs in the FedRAMP catalog. This process, however, only covers the portion of the system that is governed by the FedRAMP PA, such as the FedRAMP moderate security controls. The DoD change control process will cover the portion of the system that is governed by the DoD PA, such as the FedRAMP+ security controls. Ongoing assessment of controls that are levied by the mission owner, such as those specified in the SLA, and do not fall under the FedRAMP or DoD PAs is the responsibility of the mission owner. This division of assessment responsibility is shown in Figure 5-1.		
5.3.1								Continuous Monitoring This section pertains specifically to continuous monitoring of security controls, as defined by CNSSI 4009 and NIST SP 800-137. Further information on monitoring activities performed as part of computer network defense, are described in Section 6, Cyberspace Defense and Incident Response. Once a DoD PA is granted, the CSP is expected to maintain the security posture of the CSO through continuous and periodic vulnerability scans, DoD annual assessments, incident management, and effective implementation of operational processes and procedures. Integral to this is periodic reporting to the appropriate AO. The continuous monitoring artifacts required to maintain a DoD PA are the same as those required by FedRAMP (annual assessments, monthly vulnerability scans, etc.). However, those artifacts must include additional information for FedRAMP+ controls and DoD requirements. Continuous monitoring data flows will differ for CSPs depending on whether their CSOs have a FedRAMP JAB PA, a 3PAO assessed non-DoD federal agency ATO, or DoD assessed PA (as described in Section 4). These data flows are reflected in Figures 5-2, 5-3, and 5-4, respectively. In some cases, CSPs such as, but not limited to, DoD private CSOs or CSOs in the FedRAMP catalog with a non-DoD agency ATO will provide continuous monitoring artifacts directly to DISA. In such cases, the CSP will use commercial standard formats (e.g., comma-separated values, XML) that enable DoD to automate the ingest of continuous monitoring data. Note: For XML exchanges, National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) based XML is the preferred format IAW DoDI 8320.0743, August 3, 2015. Additional information regarding this format can be found at www.niem.gov. All FedRAMP provisionally authorized CSP CSOs are required to have FedRAMP annual assessments performed by a 3PAO for the maintenance of their FedRAMP PA. DoD also requires annual assessments performed by a 3PAO or approved DoD SCA organization for the maintenance of their level 4 and above DoD PA. It is expected that CSOs in both the FedRAMP and DoD catalogs will have a single annual assessment to cover this requirement for both FedRAMP and DoD. This means DoD will leverage and use the FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring (CONMON) process and artifacts to the greatest extent possible. CSOs in the FedRAMP catalog will follow the process described in the FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide44. DoD annual assessments will minimally include the set of controls listed in Appendix A of that document, as well as any other controls specified by the DISA AO. CSOs with a DoD PA that are not in the FedRAMP catalog will follow the DoD RMF process for continuous monitoring and associated assessments. Corresponding Security Controls: CA-7	CA-7	
5.3.1.1								Continuous Monitoring for CSOs in the FedRAMP Catalog with a DoD PA As described in Section 4.1, Assessment of Commercial/Non-DoD Cloud Services, the CSOs in the FedRAMP catalog that are eligible for DoD PAs include CSOs having a JAB PA (which is 3PAO assessed) or a 3PAO assessed federal agency ATO. All reports required by the FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide, including self- assessments, for these CSOs will be provided to the FedRAMP information system security officer (ISSO). These will be reviewed by the FedRAMP TRs (which include DoD personnel) and approved by the JAB if necessary. DoD leverages the CSOs CONMON artifacts and the work done by the FedRAMP TRs in which DoD is a part of the team. Continuous monitoring requirements for DoD are the same as those for FedRAMP, except that all reports and artifacts for FedRAMP+ C/CEs will be provided directly to DISA AO representatives as the DoD single point of CSP contact for this information. DISA will share appropriate continuous monitoring information (FedRAMP and FedRAMP+) with mission owners, AOs, and cybersecurity service providers (CSSPs). The information will be used by mission owners, their AOs, and the DISA AO to assess and authorize the CSO. Those evaluations will inform decisions to continue the ATO for the mission owner’s system and the PA for the CSP respectively. The DISA AO will coordinate closely with mission owners in the event that the withdrawal of a PA must be considered upon the basis of this requirement. Figure 5-2 shows the normal flow of continuous monitoring information if the CSP has a FedRAMP JAB PA.		
5.3.2								Change Control The DoD change control process for CSOs mirrors and leverages that of FedRAMP, with a focus on how changes affect the DoD PA and the security of hosted mission systems/applications and information. The FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Strategy Guide, dated June 6, 2014, states: “Systems are dynamic and FedRAMP anticipates that all systems are in a constant state of change. Configuration management and change control processes help maintain a secure baseline configuration of the CSP’s architecture. Routine day-to-day changes are managed through the CSP’s change management process described in their Configuration Management Plan. However, before a planned significant change takes place, CSP’s must perform a Security Impact Analysis, consistent with control CM-4, to determine if the change will adversely affect the security of the system. The Security Impact Analysis is a standard part of a CSP’s change control process as described in the CSP’s Configuration Management Plan.” As with FedRAMP, CSPs must give DoD 30-day notice prior to significant changes. If a change is made without approval that affects the risk posture of the system, the DISA AO can revoke the DoD PA. As with continuous monitoring, the change control process will differ for CSPs depending on if they are in the FedRAMP catalog and if they have a DoD assessed PA or ATO. Figure 5-5, Figure 5-6, and Figure 5-7 show these change control processes. Note: NIST SP 800-37 Revision 1, Appendix F February 201045 defines a significant change as follows: “a change that is likely to affect the security state of an information system.” Examples are provided as follows: “Significant changes to an information system may include for example: (i) installation of a new or upgraded operating system, middleware component, or application; (ii) modifications to system ports, protocols, or services; (iii) installation of a new or upgraded hardware platform; (iv) modifications to cryptographic modules or services; or (v) modifications to security controls. Examples of significant changes to the environment of operation may include for example: (i) moving to a new facility; (ii) adding new core missions or business functions; (iii) acquiring specific and credible threat information that the organization is being targeted by a threat source; or (iv) establishing new/modified laws, directives, policies, or regulations.” Corresponding Security Controls: CM-3, CM-4, CA-6	CM-3,CM-4,CA-6	
5.3.2.1								Change Control for CSOs in the FedRAMP Catalog with a DoD PA The FedRAMP Continuous Monitoring Guide defines a significant change as a change to the scope of an approved PA or an impact to the authorization boundary of the CSO. The CSP will follow procedures defined in the continuous monitoring strategy guide by submitting a FedRAMP Significant Change Security Impact Analysis Form46 to the FedRAMP PMO. The review of the security implications of significant changes will be performed at multiple layers, as reflected in Figure 5-5. The planned change will be reviewed by the FedRAMP ISSO and/or JAB technical representatives (TRs), and then forwarded to the JAB for approval. Simultaneously the DoD JAB TR will notify DISA, who will in turn notify all mission owners utilizing that CSO, the DISA AO, and the CSSP entities as defined in Section 6, Cyberspace Defense and Incident Response. During FedRAMP ISSO review, the DoD JAB TR will collect comments from DoD stakeholders and inform the FedRAMP ISSO if planned changes will adversely affect the security of the information hosted by the CSO for DoD cloud customers. DoD may communicate directly with the CSP and their 3PAO regarding change approval or concerns over the impact on DoD’s FedRAMP+ C/CEs. FedRAMP requires a security assessment be performed by a 3PAO after a significant change is implemented, with a corresponding security assessment report created. CSPs must also include all FedRAMP+ C/CEs in post-change assessments to meet DoD requirements. DISA will notify affected mission owners of proposed significant changes and provide its assessment of the change within the scope of the CSO PA. Mission owners are responsible for assessing the effects of proposed changes for effects that fall within the scope of their SLAs. When a CSO having a DoD PA is included in the FedRAMP catalog, but does not have a JAB PA, the CSP will notify DISA directly in addition to any other required points of contact. (e.g., A CSP with a non-DoD agency ATO would notify both that agency and DISA). This is required because the FedRAMP JAB does not control the agency ATO, and information may not flow from the CSP to the FedRAMP PMO and DISA. DISA will in turn notify all mission owners utilizing that CSO, the DISA AO, and the CSSP entities as defined in Section 6, Cyberspace Defense and Incident Response. The Security Impact Analysis must additionally cover the FedRAMP+ C/CEs. Once informed, DISA will review the proposed change to assess if it will, and ensure it will not, adversely affect the security of the DODIN as a whole or the DISN with respect to the impact level at which it is authorized. Any updates to the FedRAMP Security Package will be forwarded to DISA.  As with FedRAMP, DoD requires a security assessment be performed by a 3PAO after a significant change is implemented, with a corresponding security assessment report created. CSPs must also include all FedRAMP+ C/CEs in post-change assessments to meet DoD requirements. DISA will notify affected mission owners of proposed significant changes and provide its assessment of the change within the scope of the CSO PA. Mission owners are responsible for assessing the effects of proposed changes for effects that fall within the scope of their SLAs Figure 5-6 shows the normal flow of significant change information if the CSO has a 3PAO assessed non-DoD federal agency ATO listed in the FedRAMP catalog. Since the FedRAMP JAB does not control the agency ATO, information from the CSP may not flow from the authorizing agency to the FedRAMP PMO. To avoid the possibility of DoD not being informed of potential changes, CSPs must send change requests to DISA in addition to the authorizing agency.		
5.3.2.2								Change Control for DoD Assessed CSOs Figure 5-7 shows the flow of significant change for non-FedRAMP CSOs having a DoD PA or ATO assessed by a DoD SCA organization and authorized by a DoD AO. The review of significant change information will be directed by the DoD RMF, rather than the FedRAMP change control process. CSPs will have similar responsibilities but will report directly to DISA. DISA will, in turn, disseminate those artifacts to all mission owners utilizing that CSO, the DISA AO, and the CSSP entities as defined in Section 6, Cyberspace Defense and Incident Response. These entities will review the proposed change to ensure it will not adversely affect the security posture of the CSO with respect to its PA or ATO. The planned change will also be reviewed by the Mission Owners utilizing the CSO for any adverse impact with regard to their specific usage of the CSO.		
5.3.3								Support for Financial Audits – SOC 1 Type II Reports The 20 May 2019 DoD CIO Memo titled System and Organization Control Report Requirement for Audit Impacting Cloud/Data Center Hosting Organizations and Application Service Providers stipulates that CSPs and their subcontractors provide annual System and Organization Control (SOC 1) Type II reports in support of DoD financial audits. DoD mission owners must add this requirement to their contracts with the CSPs. Mission owners and CSPs must refer to the memo and its “Attachment A” for details of fulfilling the requirement.  Note: Cloud/data center hosting organizations is interpreted here as CSPs providing IaaS CSOs while application service providers (ASPs) is interpreted here as CSPs providing PaaS/SaaS CSOs. In both cases, the contracted CSP must obtain and provide reports from any and all subcontractors (e.g., data centers and CSP’s hosting their CSO infrastructure) and from any CSPs whose CSOs the contracted CSP (ASP) is leveraging as an external service to provide their complete CSO. As a condition of receiving a DoD PA, CSPs must demonstrate they have the ability to meet the requirement to produce SOC 1 Type II reports as stipulated in the memo and attachment for themselves and for any subcontractors and to coordinate the time period with the federal government’s fiscal year. The memo and attachment are included here for the reader’s convenience; however, the mission owner and CSP should refer to the memo found at the link in the footnote to ensure there have been no changes since the publication of this release of the CC SRG. The memo is as follows: Beginning fiscal year 2018, the Department of Defense (DoD) is under full annual financial statement audits. In support of these audits, DoD components are directed to obtain annual SOC 1 Type II reports from cloud/data center hosting organizations and application service providers (ASPs) hosting or delivering financial or non-financial applications that impact internal controls relevant to multiple DoD financial statement audits. DoD components should work with their financial and contract personnel to determine if their cloud/data center hosting organization or ASP is affected and to ensure service organizations and relevant sub-service organizations submit SOC 1 Type II reports in accordance with requirements in Attachment A. In those instances where only a single DoD audit is impacted, and alternate solution is the inclusion of a right to audit clause in relevant service organization contracts. Attachment A System and Organization Control (SOC 1) Type II Reporting Requirements for Service Organizations The following are SOC 1 Type II reporting requirements to address the specific needs of Department of Defense (DoD) financial statement auditors where service organizations are providing audit impacting platform or infrastructure as a service (cloud/data center hosting services) and/or software as a service (application service providers). Cloud/Data Center Hosting Organizations and Application Service Providers (ASPs) 1. The SOC 1 report must be prepared in accordance with the following auditing standards: o Attestation Standards Clarified (AT-C) Section 320, “Reporting on an Examination of Controls at a Service Organization Relevant to User Entities’ Internal Control Over Financial Reporting” o AT-C Section 105, “Concepts Common to All Attestation Engagements” o AT-C Section 205, “Examination Engagements” 2. The SOC 1 report must address the design and operating effectiveness of the service organization’s controls to meet identified control objectives (generally referred to as a Type II report). 3. The SOC 1 report will include information system general control objectives that are comparable with the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) Federal Information System Controls Audit Manual (FISCAM) control objectives for security management, access controls, configuration management, segregation of duties, and contingency planning. 4. The SOC 1 report period will begin October 1 and end on June 30 of each year. 5. The SOC 1 report will be delivered to DoD (FIAR directorate) no later than August 15 of each year. 6. The service organization will provide a bridge letter to DoD no later than October 8 of each year to address the period from July 1 through September 30. Incremental Requirements for ASPs In addition to the requirements for cloud/data center hosting organizations, SOC 1 reports for ASPs will include the following incremental requirements for relevant application(s). 1. The report will include business process application control objectives that are comparable with the GAO FISCAM control objectives for the completeness, accuracy, and validity of inputs, processing, outputs, and master data. 2. The SOC 1 report will identify key inputs and the service organization’s rationale and approach for identifying the key inputs. 3. The SOC 1 report will identify inbound/outbound interfaces and the service organization’s rationale and approach for identifying the key interfaces. 4. The SOC 1 report will identify automated data/transaction edits and the service organization’s rationale and approach for identifying the key edits. 5. The SOC 1 report will identify key outputs/reports and the service organization’s rationale and approach for identifying the key outputs/reports.		
5.4								CSP Use of DoD Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) In accordance with FedRAMP’s selection of IA-2(12), which states “The information system accepts and electronically verifies personal identity verification (PIV) credentials”, and the FedRAMP supplemental guidance, which states “Include Common Access Card (CAC), i.e., the DoD technical implementation of PIV/FIPS 201/HSPD-12,” CSPs are required to integrate with and use the DoD PKI for DoD entity authentication (e.g., a web portal that DoD and Federal Government Mission Owner’s privileged users log in to for configuring the CSO). The following sections describe how the CSP fulfills its responsibilities with additional detail in the supporting subsections:		
5.4-Impact_level_2								Whenever a CSP is responsible for authentication of entities and/or identifying a hosted DoD information system, the CSP will use DoD PKI certificates in compliance with DoDI 8520.03. CSPs will enforce the use of a physical token referred to as the “Common Access Card (CAC)” or “alt token” for the authentication of DoD privileged users. CSPs must make use of DoD Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) or certificate revocation list (CRL) resources for checking revocation of DoD certificates and DoD certificate authorities; and must follow DoD instructions and industry best practices for the management and protection of cryptographic keys.		
5.4-Impact_levels_45								Whenever a CSP is responsible for authentication of entities and/or identifying a hosted DoD information system, the CSP will use DoD PKI certificates in compliance with DoDI 8520.03. CSPs will enforce the use of a physical token referred to as the “Common Access Card (CAC)” or “alt token” for the authentication of DoD privileged and DoD non-privileged users. CSPs must make use of DoD OCSP or CRL resources for checking revocation of DoD certificates and DoD certificate authorities; and must follow DoD instructions and industry best practices for the management and protection of cryptographic keys. DoD issued PKI server certificates will be used to identify the CSP's DoD customer ordering/service management portals and SaaS applications and services contracted by and dedicated to DoD use.		
5.4-Impact_level_6								Whenever an on-premises CSO is responsible for authentication of DoD entities and/or identifying a hosted DoD information system, the CSP will use NSS PKI certificates in compliance with DoDI 8520.03 and CNSSP-25. CSPs will enforce the use of a physical token referred to as the CNSS NSS Hardware Token for the authentication of DoD Mission owner and CSP privileged and non-privileged end users. When implementing NSS PKI, CSPs must make use of NSS OCSP or CRL resources for checking revocation of NSS certificates and NSS Certificate Authorities; and must follow CNSS/NSA instructions for the management and protection of cryptographic keys. CNSS issued PKI server certificates will be used to identify the CSP's DoD customer ordering/service management portals and SaaS applications and services contracted by and dedicated to DoD use. Note: A CSP must PK enable their customer ordering/service management portals for all service offerings and their SaaS service offerings for general DoD user access at levels 4 and up or provide a customer configurable service offering to permit PK enabling and integration with the required PKI. For complete compliance the CSP will integrate with the DoD PKI and the Federal PKI for levels 2 through 5. For Level 6 the CSP will integrate with the NSS (SIPRNet) PKI. Both the DoD and NSS PKI are operated by DISA47 while the Federal PKI is operated by GSA48. PK enabled customer ordering/service management portals may require a separate URL or dedicated application/application interface as best determined by the CSP to meet the Federal Government requirement. Corresponding Security Controls: IA-2, IA-2(1), IA-2(2), IA-2(3), IA-2(8), IA-2(11), IA-2(12), IA-5(2), IA-5(11), IA-7, IA-8 Note: NSS PKI and SIPRNet token requirements for off-premises Level 6 CSPs and CSOs need to be coordinated with OUSD(I) and DSS. Associated policies are addressed above in Section 4.2, Assessment of DoD Cloud Services and Enterprise Services Applications under the Impact Level 6 topic. Coordinated guidance and requirements for off-premises CSPs and their CSOs for a DoD Level 6 provisional authorization may appear in a future release of the CC SRG. This note applies to all subsections in Section 5.4.		
5.4.1								Identification, Authentication, and Access Control Credentials DoDI 8520.03, Identity Authentication for Information Systems is the DoD policy that defines the credentials that DoD privileged and non-privileged users must use to identify themselves to DoD information systems to be authenticated before being granted access. It also defines the credentials that DoD information systems use to identify themselves to each other. This is fully applicable to DoD information systems instantiated on cloud services. Additionally, CNSS Policy #25 and CNSSI 1300 provide similar guidance for NSS. For the purpose of this discussion, the process of identification and authentication will be referred to as I&A.		
5.4.1.1								Mission Owner Credentials for CSP and Mission System Interfaces This section defines the mission owner access control credentials required at each information impact level IAW DoDI 8520.03 in the following categories: • Mission owner privileged user access to the CSP’s customer ordering and service management interfaces or portals for all service offerings (IaaS/PaaS, SaaS). o Integration with DoD PKI is typically a CSP responsibility. Minimally, the CSP is responsible for providing capabilities that enable mission owners to configure a CSP service offering that integrates with DoD PKI. • Mission owner non-privileged user (i.e., mission application end-users) access to CSP SaaS offerings. o Integration with DoD PKI is typically a CSP responsibility. Minimally, the CSP is responsible for providing capabilities that enable mission owners to configure a CSP service offering that integrates with DoD PKI. • Non-privileged user access to mission owner’s systems and applications instantiated on IaaS/PaaS. (i.e., mission application end-users) o Implementation is a mission owner responsibility. • Mission Owner privileged user access to their systems and applications instantiated on IaaS/PaaS for the purpose of administration and maintenance. o Implementation is a mission owner responsibility. Table 5-3 lists the mission owner credential types required at each impact level for various use cases and the policy under which they are required. The DoD policy column identifies the authentication methods that mission owners must implement for use in the systems and applications they instantiate in a CSP’s CSO. This is primarily applicable to IaaS/PaaS. The IA2(12) column identifies the authentication methods that CSPs must implement for use in the service offerings they provide to their DoD customer. This primarily applies to SaaS and CSP's customer ordering/service management portals.		
Table 5-3	Level 2							Implemented by Mission Owner IAW DoD Policy  Non-privileged user access to publicly released information requires no I&A, unless the information owner requires it. If required, the mission owner determines the type of I&A to be used.  Non-privileged user access to nonpublicly released non-CUI and noncritical mission information minimally requires I&A through the use of a User Identifier (UID) and password that meets DoD length and complexity requirements. The mission owner is encouraged to require the use of a stronger I&A technology in accordance with the sensitivity of the private information (e.g., UID/Password with two-step verification, two-factor token based onetime password, DoDapproved PKI token/certificate, CAC/PKI, etc.)  Mission owner privileged users’ access to administer mission owner systems/applications instantiated on IaaS/PaaS requires the use of DoD CAC/PKI or Alt Token/PKI. Implemented by CSP IAW FedRAMP's selection of IA-2(12)  Non-privileged user access to nonpublicly released non-CUI and noncritical mission information in the CSP’s SaaS offering minimally requires I&A through the use of a User Identifier (UID) and password that meets DoD length and complexity requirements. The mission owner is encouraged to require the use of a stronger I&A technology in accordance with the sensitivity of the private information (e.g., two-factor token-based onetime password, DoDapproved49 PKI token/certificate, CAC/PKI, etc.)  Mission owner’s privileged users’ access to the CSP's customer ordering/service management portals for all service offerings requires the use of DoD CAC/PKI or Alt Token/PKI.		
Table 5-3	Level 4 and 5							Implemented by Mission Owner IAW DoD Policy  Non-privileged user access to CUI, non-CUI critical mission data, and/or unclassified NSS (L5) requires the use of DoD CAC/PKI or other DoDapproved PKI50.  Mission Owner privileged users’ access to administer Mission Owner systems/applications instantiated on IaaS/PaaS requires the use of DoD CAC/PKI or Alt Token/PKI. Implemented by CSP IAW FedRAMP's selection of IA-2(12)  Non-privileged user access to CUI, non-CUI critical mission data, and/or unclassified NSS (L5) information in the CSP’s SaaS offering requires the use of DoD CAC/PKI or other DoDapproved PKI51.  Mission Owner’s privileged users’ access to the CSP's customer ordering/service management portals for all service offerings requires the use of DoD CAC/PKI or Alt Token/PKI.		
Table 5-3	Level 6							Implemented by Mission Owner IAW DoD Policy  Non-privileged user access to classified information requires the use of NSS SIPRNet Token/PKI.  Mission owner privileged users’ access to administer mission owner systems/applications instantiated on IaaS/PaaS requires the use of NSS SIPRNet Token/PKI. Implemented by CSP IAW FedRAMP's selection of IA-2(12)  Non-privileged user access to classified information in the CSP’s SaaS offering requires the use of NSS SIPRNet Token/PKI.  Mission Owner’s privileged users’ access to the CSP's customer ordering/service management portals for all service offerings requires the use of NSS SIPRNet Token/PKI.		
Table 5-3	Note 1							Note: Mission owner personnel that are involved in managing any portion of a CSP’s service offering or who are able to order services from the CSP (i.e., possesses accounts on the CSP’s customer ordering and service management interfaces or portals for any service offering (IaaS/PaaS, SaaS)), are considered privileged users by DoD and therefore are required to authenticate using DoD CAC, or alt token IAW DoDI 8520.03.		
Table 5-3	Note 2							Note: It is recognized that some Level 4/5 systems must support some non-privileged user populations (e.g., retirees) that cannot receive a DoD CAC/PKI or other DoD-approved PKI authenticator to gain access to CUI (e.g., PII/PHI) for which they have a legal right to access. In cases such as these, the mission owner will seek AO approval to use an assertion service that is compliant with DoD standards. An assertion service is a DoD strong authentication mechanism that provides additional challenges and responses to prove an identity IAW DoD Cybersecurity Discipline Implementation Plan, October 2015, Amended February 201652. An example of this is a two-step verification where an access code is sent to the user via a different communications path than the one accessing the website or application after entering the UID/password combination. In effect, this becomes a two-factor authentication system.		
5.4.1.2								CSP Privileged User Credentials This section defines the I&A and access control credentials that the CSP privileged users must use when administering the CSP’s infrastructure supporting mission owner’s systems.		
5.4.1.2-Impact_levels_24								IAW the separation requirements for Levels 2 and 4 described in Section 5.2.2.1, Impact Level 2 Location and Separation Requirements, and 5.2.2.2 ,Impact Level 4 Location and Separation Requirements, and FedRAMP's selection of IA-2(1) and IA-2(3), the CSP must minimally implement two factor authentication for CSP privileged user access to administer and maintain CSP infrastructure supporting federal and DoD contracted services. While the best practice of using a hardware token technology implementing a multi-factor onetime password or PKI certificate technology solution similar to DoDI 8520.03 Credential Strength D is preferred, these identity credentials minimally use a multi-token solution or a multi-factor one-time password solution similar to DoDI 8520.03 Credential Strength C.		
5.4.1.2-Impact_level_5								IAW the separation requirements for Level 5 described in Section 5.2.2.3, Impact Level 5 Location and Separation Requirements and DoD policy, the CSP must implement a strong two-factor I&A capability for CSP privileged user access to administer and maintain dedicated CSP infrastructure supporting federal and DoD contracted services. The strong twofactor I&A capability must be dedicated to the dedicated CSP infrastructure. These identity credentials minimally use a hardware token technology implementing a multi-factor one-time password or PKI certificate technology solution similar to DoDI 8520.03 Credential Strength D. Note: While DoDI 8520.03 requires that all administrators of DoD or partner managed systems use identity Credential Strength E (i.e., hardware token PKI technology issued by an identity credential service provider that is either a Federal agency, an approved shared service provider under the Federal PKI Policy Authority Program, or an identity credential service provider that has been specifically approved by the DoD CIO as a credential strength E service provider e.g., DoD CAC or ALT) for privileged access to DoD systems, DoD is not enforcing this requirement on CSP infrastructure administrators/privileged users managing CSP assets at this time.		
5.4.1.2-Impact_level_6								IAW the separation requirements for level 6 described in Section 5.2.2.4, Impact Level 6 Location and Separation Requirements and CNSS policy, the CSP must implement SIPRNet Token/PKI authentication for CSP privileged user access to administer and maintain dedicated CSP infrastructure supporting federal and DoD contracted level 6 services connected to SIPRNet.		
5.4.2								Public Key (PK) Enabling Public Key (PK) enabling refers to the process through which hosts and applications are enabled to hold or use PKI certificates for the following: • Identifying themselves to other hosts. • Establishing secure communications paths. • Accepting DoD PKI certificates for system and user authentication. • Validating the validity of PKI certificates while making use of the DoD OCSP responder resources and/or CRL resources. The Cyber Exchange website page Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Public Key Enabling (PKE)53 provides information needed to PK-enable mission owner’s systems/applications instantiated on CSP’s IaaS/PaaS offerings and CSP’s PK-enabling of SaaS offerings and service ordering/management portals/interfaces.		
5.5								Policy, Guidance, Operational Constraints DoD-specific policy, guidance and operational constraints must be followed as appropriate by CSPs. DISA will evaluate CSP submitted equivalencies to any specific security control, SRG, or STIG requirement on a case-by-case basis.		
5.5.1								SRG/STIG Compliance Mission owners must use all applicable DoD SRGs and STIGs to secure all mission owner systems and applications instantiated on CSP’s IaaS and PaaS at all levels. CSP’s CSOs are subject to the FedRAMP selected SP 800-53 security control CM-6. This is applicable to all infrastructure, hardware, and software, which constitutes and supports the CSP’s CSO whether it is IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS. CSOs are assessed under FedRAMP in accordance with the security configuration checklists specified in the FedRAMP value. All STIGs and SRGs can be found on DISA’s Cyber Exchange website54 along with an SRG/STIG Applicability Guide55. DoD recommends that STIGs and/or SRGs be used by CSPs to fulfill the CM-6 baseline configuration requirement for systems that support DoD systems as follows:		
5.5.1-Impact_level_2								While the use of STIGs and SRGs by CSPs is preferable, industry standard baselines such as those provided by the Center for Internet Security (CIS) benchmarks are an acceptable alternative to the STIGs and SRGs.		
5.5.1-Impact_levels_456								STIGs are applicable if the CSP uses the product a STIG addresses. SRGs are applicable in lieu of STIGs if a product-specific STIG is not available. However, the SP 800- 53 control applies whether or not a STIG or SRG is available. While the DoD level 4/5/6 value for CM-6 is to use DoD SRGs and STIGs as applicable, DISA will evaluate the CSP’s usage of commercial equivalencies (e.g., CIS benchmarks) on a case-by-case basis. For dedicated infrastructure that only serves DoD tenants, CSPs must use all applicable DoD STIGs and/or SRGs to secure all DoD contracted cloud computing services. This applies at levels 4 and above for IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS offerings. Corresponding Security Controls: CM-6	CM-6	
5.6								Physical Facilities and Personnel Requirements The following sections discuss facility and personnel requirements as they align to the impact levels.		
5.6.1								Facilities Requirements		
5.6.1-Impact_level_2								CSP data processing facilities supporting level 2 information will meet the physical security requirements defined in the FedRAMP moderate baseline.		
5.6.1-Impact_levels_45								CSP data processing facilities supporting level 4 and 5 CSOs/information will meet the physical security requirements defined in the FedRAMP moderate baseline as well as any FedRAMP+ C/CEs related to physical security.		
5.6.1-Impact_level_6								DoD data on-premises processing facilities that support cloud services infrastructure and classified service offerings will be housed in facilities (designated as a secure room) designed, built, and approved for open storage commensurate with the highest classification level of the information stored, processed, or transmitted as defined in DoDM 5200.01 Volume 3, DoD Information Security Program: Protection of Classified Information56.		
5.6.2								CSP Personnel Requirements The concept of cloud operations, given the shared responsibilities between multiple organizations along with the advanced technology being applied within this space, can impact personnel security requirements. The ability for a CSP’s personnel to alter the security controls/environment of a provisioned offering and the security of the system/application/data processing within the offering may vary based on the processes/controls used by the CSP. The components of the underlying infrastructure (e.g., hypervisor, storage subsystems, network devices) and the type of service (e.g., IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) provided by the CSP will further define the access and resulting risk that CSP’s employees can pose to DoD mission or data. While CSP personnel are typically not approved for access to customer data/information for need-to-know reasons (except for information approved for public release), they are considered to be able to gain access to the information through their duties. Access to DoD information at the various levels above level 2 is limited by national affiliation. For other than U.S. citizens or non-citizen U.S. nationals as defined in 8 U.S. Code § 140857, national affiliation is defined in 22 CFR 120.1558 – U.S. person and 120.16 – foreign person. The limitations by information impact level are as follows:		
5.6.2-Impact_level_2								CSP personnel having access to the systems processing/storing DoD public information may be U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, U.S. persons, or foreign persons. i.e., there is no restriction. 	PS-2,PS-3	
5.6.2-Impact_levels_45								CSP personnel having access to the systems processing/storing DoD CUI information or to the information itself at level 4/5 must be U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, or U.S. persons. No foreign persons may have such access.	PS-2,PS-3	
5.6.2-Impact_level_6								CSP personnel having access to systems processing/storing classified information or to the information itself must be U.S. citizens.	PS-2,PS-3	
5.6.2.1								CSP Personnel Requirements – PS-2: Position Categorization The FedRAMP moderate baseline includes the personnel security controls PS-2, PS-3, and enhancement PS-3(3). Under PS-2, the CSP is required to “assign a risk designation to all organizational positions,” and “establish screening criteria for individuals filling those positions.” Supplemental guidance states “position risk designations reflect Office of Personnel Management (OPM) policy and guidance.” The OPM position designation process takes into account the duties, level of supervision, and the scope over which misconduct might have an effect (i.e., worldwide/government-wide, multi-agency, or agency). For IT system and information access it also takes into account the sensitivity level of the information accessed (i.e., non-CUI, CUI, and classified). The OPM Position Designation Tool59 is provided to enable federal agencies a methodical and consistent means to determine position sensitivity for national security positions (e.g., positions concerned with the protection of the nation from foreign aggression or espionage or positions that require regular access to classified information) and public trust positions (e.g., positions at the high or moderate risk levels, which includes responsibility for protection of information security systems). Position risk levels are determined using the position designation tool. A position may have both national security and public trust considerations that will jointly impact the sensitivity level and ultimately the type of security investigation required. The position sensitivity tool will be used to determine position sensitivity, position risk levels and investigation requirements for key CSP personnel. DoD’s primary concern is CSP personnel with direct access to or the ability to gain access to DoD information, or that have responsibilities that can affect the security of the information technology processing, storing or transmitting that information. Under OPM policy, such a person with access to CUI or classified information is designated as filling a position designated as “critical-sensitive” or “high risk.” However, if the person’s “work is carried out under technical review of a higher authority” (i.e., a person holding a “critical-sensitive” or “high risk” position), then the position may be designated as “noncritical-sensitive” or “moderate risk.” Positions only having access to non-CUI and publicly released information could have a designation of “non-sensitive” or “low risk.” All positions are considered to have some level of “public trust.” From a DoD policy perspective under PS-2 and IAW DoDM 5200.02, Personnel Security Program60 Category I automated data processing (ADP) (ADP-1 or IT-1), positions include those in which an individual is responsible for the planning, direction, and implementation of a computer security program; has major responsibility for the direction, planning and design of a computer system, including the hardware and software; or can access a system during the operation or maintenance in such a way and with a relatively high risk for causing grave damage or realize a significant personal gain. These positions are designated “critical-sensitive.” Category II automated data processing (ADP) (ADP-2 or IT-2) positions include those in which an individual may have the same responsibilities listed for ADP-1 but whose work is technically reviewed by a higher authority of the ADP-I category to ensure the integrity of the system. These positions are designated “noncritical-sensitive.” These designations are consistent with the OPM position designation system document and automated tool. To receive a DoD PA, the CSP must demonstrate that their personnel position categorization and compliance with PS-2 is equivalent to the OPM position designations for the similar CSP positions to the “critical-sensitive” (e.g., DoD’s ADP-1) or “high risk”; “noncritical-sensitive” (e.g., DoD’s ADP-2) or “moderate risk”; and/or “non-sensitive” or “low risk” (i.e., access to only non-CUI and public information) position designations. These designations drive the level of screening to be established IAW the second half of PS-2 and for PS-3.		
5.6.2.2								CSP Personnel Requirements – PS-3: Background Investigations Under PS-3 and PS-3(3), the CSP is required to “screen individuals prior to authorizing access to the information system,” and re-screen IAW an organizational defined frequency. PS-3(3) addresses “additional personnel screening criteria” for information “requiring special protection” such as CUI. Per the FedRAMP supplemental guidance for PS-3, found in the FedRAMP Control Specific Contract Clauses v2, June 6, 2014 document61, an agency must stipulate, “IAW OPM and OMB requirements,” the type of background investigation required for CSP personnel having access to or who can gain access to information. For DoD, the minimum designations are defined by level as follows: 		
5.6.2.2-Impact_level_2								CSP personnel supporting level 2 cloud service offerings will meet the personnel security requirements and undergo background checks as defined in OPM policy IAW the FedRAMP moderate baseline. As such the minimum background investigation required for CSP personnel having access to level 2 information based on a “non-sensitive” or “low risk” position designation (i.e., position only has access to public and non-CUI non-critical mission information), is a National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC). The position sensitivity or risk level and resulting investigation may be elevated beyond the minimum requirement as determined by the mission owner/AO, based on additional risk considerations. For instance, if the confidentiality, integrity or availability (CIA) of information is determined to be based on a “noncritical-sensitive” or “moderate risk” position using the tool, a National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) (for “noncritical-sensitive” contractors), or a Moderate Risk Background Investigation (MBI) (for “moderate risk” positions) may be required.		
5.6.2.2-Impact_levels_45								CSP personnel supporting Level 4 and 5 cloud service offerings will meet the personnel security requirements and undergo background checks as defined in OPM policy IAW the FedRAMP Moderate baseline, the FedRAMP+ CEs related to personnel security, and DoD personnel security policies. As such the minimum background investigation required for CSP personnel having access to level 4 and 5 information based on a “critical-sensitive” (e.g., DoD’s ADP-1) position designation, is a Single Scope Background Investigation (SSBI) or a Background Investigation (BI) for a “high risk” position designation. The minimum background investigation required for CSP personnel having access to Level 4 and 5 information based on a “noncritical-sensitive” (e.g., DoD’s ADP-2) is a National Agency Check with Law and Credit (NACLC) (for “noncritical-sensitive” contractors), or a Moderate Risk Background Investigation (MBI) for a “moderate risk” position designation. To receive a DoD PA for Level 2, 4, or 5, the CSP must comply with the investigation requirements as listed for personnel requiring access to DoD systems and/or data. Personnel who have access to the CSP infrastructure only (i.e., at the hypervisor or below for IaaS or PaaS/SaaS CSO applications and below without access to DoD customer systems or data) must comply with OPM investigation requirements or the CSP must demonstrate that their personnel background investigations and compliance with PS-3 and PS-3(3) are consistent with OPM investigation requirements for each position designation. Note: DoD suggests that the CSP request equivalent investigations to those noted above from an investigation contractor listed on the GSA Federal Acquisition Service Contractor Listing for Category 595 27 HR Support: Pre-Employment Background Investigations website. 62 In using such a contractor and requesting equivalent investigations the CSP can demonstrate equivalency toward receiving a DoD PA, and preparing for the needed investigations following contract award.		
5.6.2.2-Impact_level_6								In accordance with PS-3(1), invoked by the CNSSI 1253 Classified Information Overlay, personnel having access to a secure room, the infrastructure supporting classified processing, or handling classified information, in addition to meeting the public trust position suitability/investigation requirements (e.g., a favorably adjudicated SSBI for a system administrator in a DoD ADP-1 position) must have a security clearance at the appropriate level. Systems and network administrators (i.e., privileged users), while typically not approved to handle classified information for need-to-know reasons, are considered to have access to classified information through their duties. Therefore, these individuals require a clearance at the appropriate level for the classified information stored, processed, or transmitted. DoD personnel clearances are granted through DoD processes as defined in DoDI 5200.0263 and the IAW DoDM 5200.0264, both entitled DoD Personnel Security Program (PSP). Commercial CSPs’ personnel clearances are granted through the Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Process65. Contracts for both on-premises and off-premises Level 6 CSOs will include language related to the contractor requiring access to classified information IAW 48 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Subpart 4.4 - Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry66 and Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) Section 52.204-2 - Security Requirements67. Such contractors are required to comply with NISP policies as discussed as cited above WRT organizational facilities clearances and cleared personnel. To receive a DoD PA for level 6, the CSP must either have a facility clearance and cleared personnel who will manage the CSO (including top level corporate management), or demonstrate the ability to meet the requirements for such, as defined in Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Process. For on-premises Level 6 CSOs facilities and personnel clearances will be handled as with any other DoD contract where the contractor needs access to classified information or as required for other purposes. For off-premises Level 6 CSO facilities and personnel clearances, will be handled through the contracting process as with any other Defense Industrial Base (DIB) contractor. This process is the purview of OUSD(I) and DSS.		
5.6.2.3								Mission Owner Responsibilities Regarding CSP Personnel Requirements In addition to the above requirements, the FedRAMP Control Specific Contract Clauses v268, also states the following: “Agencies leveraging FedRAMP Provisional Authorizations will be responsible for conducting their own Background Investigations and or accepting reciprocity from other agencies that have implemented Cloud Service Provider systems.” It also states Agencies are responsible for the screening process and may want to stipulate additional screening requirements. As part of the FedRAMP+ assessment, the processes used by the CSP will be evaluated and discussed in the PA as appropriate. Additionally, mission owners may require that some CSP personnel have clearances in the event classified information sharing may be needed at some point in time. This may be based on the criticality of the CSO’s use case and the criticality or type of information. DoD components and/or mission owners must review the investigation type required for all position designations and address investigation requirements and any clearance requirements as well as funding in their contracts with the CSP.		
5.6.2.4								Training Requirements DoD 8570.01-M, Information Assurance Workforce Improvement Program, Change 3, January 24, 201269 describes the DoD IA Workforce Improvement Program. This manual requires DoD IA personnel to be categorized and sets experience, training, and certification standards. DoD CSPs and mission owners must comply with DoD 8570.01-M. CSPs operating at impact level 6 are also required to meet the requirements of DoD 8570.01-M for their personnel. However, non-DoD CSPs at impact levels 2-5 are not subject to these requirements. CSPs at all impact levels are however, required to train security personnel as described in security control AT-3. The determination to not levy DoD 8570.01-M on commercial CSPs is based on the complexities of attempting to change how a commercial CSP that serves customers outside of DoD hires and trains personnel. Commercial CSP security personnel training will be assessed for compliance with security control AT-3 as part of the FedRAMP and DoD PA assessments.		
5.7								Data Spill Per CNSSI 4009, CNSS Glossary70, a data spill or “spillage” is an unauthorized transfer of classified information or Controlled Unclassified Information to an information system that is not accredited for the applicable security level of the data or information. A data spill is a cyber-incident that requires immediate reporting and response from both the mission owner and CSP in order to minimize the scope of the spill and the risk to DoD data. Mission owners will report the incident via their normal channels; the CSP must report the spill to the mission/information owner as well as follow the requirements in Section 6.5 Cyber Incident Reporting and Response. While the mission owner will most likely detect a spillage within their own dataset, the CSP might also detect a spillage. CSP detection may depend on a particular service offering where the CSP might have intentional access to the content of a mission owner information system. Cloud environments present a unique challenge for data spill response. Data spills in traditional IT are typically remediated or “cleaned” by sanitizing affected hardware to ensure that reconstruction of spilled data is impossible or impractical. This process requires access to physical storage media and frequently involves storage resources being taken offline until the cleanup is complete. Such loss of availability is not acceptable in a cloud environment with multiple tenants sharing the same infrastructure. CSP use of storage virtualization can generate numerous, dynamic instantiations of data and makes physical data locations difficult or impossible to ascertain. This makes physical sanitization methods non-viable for data spill remediation in cloud services. These challenges require a method for mitigating data spill cyber incidents that occur in the cloud. Where the mission owner has control over the cloud environment and/or how their data is stored as in IaaS and some PaaS CSOs, cryptographic erase described in Section 5.11.1, Cryptographic Erase, provides such a method. Cryptographic erase is a high-assurance way of ensuring data at rest can no longer be read. Additionally, file deletion will most likely ensure the file’s location will be overwritten with new data. This will typically happen quickly in a high use cloud environment. CE coupled with file deletion is faster and more practical than physical sanitization methods in large-scale virtualized environments used by cloud services. Further, DoD control of encryption keys permits mission owners to address data spill incidents without alerting the CSP to the presence of unauthorized data. However, CE is only an option for data that is encrypted. Mission owners should ensure all data is encrypted at rest consistent with Section 5.11, Encryption of Data-at-Rest in Commercial Cloud Storage. Upon discovery of a data spill, mission owners should cryptographically erase unauthorized data by deleting the associated decryption key(s), consistent with NIST SP 800-88 Rev 1. Mission owners must also take any necessary steps to remove unauthorized data that may exist in an unencrypted state, such as in memory of a running VM. Due to data backup and disaster recovery methods used by mission owners and CSPs, data spills could affect associated storage. Data spills remediation must extend to storage media where the spilled data might migrate. All backups and mirrored storage affected by the spill must be remediated. Mission owners are responsible for ensuring that all copies of spilled data are cryptographically erased. Timely detection, reporting, and response are key to limiting the migration of spilled data under these circumstances. Data spills that involve unauthorized data being stored in an unencrypted state in a CSO must be mitigated by the mission owner utilizing any available option to make such data unrecoverable. The response to such an event will likely be limited to methods that provide less assurance than cryptographic erase. Mission owners that do not or cannot use encryption at rest must create data spill response procedures that enumerate all data erasure options in a given CSO. Upon discovery of such an incident, a risk analysis should be performed to determine the best course of action to mitigate the risk of reconstruction of unauthorized data. This may or may not include alerting the CSP to the presence of unauthorized data in order to gain cooperation in mitigating the incident. Where the mission owner does not have control over the cloud environment and/or how their data is stored as in most SaaS and some PaaS CSOs, the CSP must provide capabilities within the CSO that can be activated when a spillage is detected. These capabilities should be under the control of the mission owner. Granular DAR encryption and data deletion capabilities at the file or database record/field level along with Crypto Erase should be part of such capabilities. CSPs must provide a spillage remediation plan based on their various and specific data storage systems and processes addressing the above and mission owner control of capabilities for all CSOs as part of their provisional authorization package. This plan must detail how a spillage in any of the CSP’s data storage facilities of offerings is able to be remediated. Alternate innovative methods for cloud data spill protection/remediation will be assessed for equivalency to standard methods and approved if found sufficient.

5.8								Data Retrieval and Destruction for Off-Boarding from a CSO Off-boarding is the set of activities that take place when a mission owner terminates use of a CSO. An off-boarding process is required when a mission owner migrates to a new cloud service, a mission reaches end of life, a contract ends, or a CSP ceases operations. The offboarding process is split into two stages: 1- data retrieval/migration and 2- data sanitization or destruction. Mission owners must prepare for an eventual CSO off-boarding, and CSPs must support the capability in a timely manner. Upon request by the mission owner, the CSP will make all mission owner data stored in a CSO available for electronic transfer out of the CSP environment in a standard, non-proprietary format. CSPs must also make available all audit logs relevant to the mission owner’s use of the CSO. This includes all audit content specified by the AU-2 security control for the time period specified by AU-11. Refer to Section 5.2.3, DoD Data Ownership and CSP Use of DoD Data for additional information. CSOs that enable mission owners to download their data on demand and delete or request destruction of data may not require specific CSP action to fulfill this requirement. Each mission owner may also request different means of data transfer (for example, as called out in the SLA), at its discretion. Cryptographic erase, described in Section 5.11.1, Cryptographic Erase, provides a highassurance way of ensuring data at rest can no longer be read. Upon successful transfer of data out of a CSO, mission owners with data that is encrypted at rest must cryptographically erase all such mission data and take action to ensure that no data remains in the CSO in an unencrypted state. All backups maintained in the CSO’s infrastructure, from which the mission owner is departing, must also be cryptographically erased. Mission owners should also request that all mission data be deleted or made logically inaccessible as per normal CSP procedure for departing customers. Upon verification of successful mission owner transfer of data, CSPs must immediately delete or otherwise make all mission owner data irretrievable. CSPs remain responsible for sanitizing or destroying all storage devices that held DoD data at the hardware’s end-of-life, even after off-boarding is complete IAW Section 5.9, Reuse and Disposal of Storage Media and Hardware. DoD mission owners using non-DoD service offerings must be capable of migrating their data at any time. This means that mission owners must have the ability to receive their data from a cloud service on short notice. This capability can be supported in the form of available local storage infrastructure, or a cloud service offered by a different CSP capable of accepting data in a short time frame. This is to ensure that mission owners can quickly retrieve their data in case of a sudden shutdown of a CSO. (e.g., A CSP declares bankruptcy and plans to shut down services). This concern is also mitigated by the mission owner’s use of effective backup procedures as described in Section 5.12, Backup. Corresponding Security Controls: DM-2, MP-6	DM-2,MP-6	
5.9								Reuse and Disposal of Storage Media and Hardware CSPs will ensure that no residual DoD data exists on all storage devices decommissioned and disposed of, reused in an environment not governed by an agreement between the CSP and DoD, or transferred to a third party; as required by the FedRAMP selected security control MP-6.	DM-2,MP-6	
5.9-Impact_levels_45								CSPs may not reuse or dispose of storage hardware until all DoD data has been successfully removed. The CSP will minimally ensure this by “Purging” all data on devices prior to decommissioning, disposal, reuse, or transfer, in accordance with NIST SP 800-88, Revision 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization71. Devices that are unable to be cleared or purged must be physically destroyed, as defined in NIST SP 800-88 Rev 1. When there is any doubt to the success of the cleared or purged process, the storage device must be destroyed in accordance with NIST SP 800-88 Rev 1.	DM-2,MP-6	
5.9-Impact_level_6								On-premises CSP’s may not dispose of or reuse storage hardware at a lower sensitivity or classification level but will ensure classified data is irretrievable from decommissioned devices by sanitizing them in accordance with NSA/CSS Storage Device Declassification Manual 9-1272.	DM-2,MP-6	
5.10								Architecture This section of the CC SRG provides guidance on the various architectural considerations related to DoD’s use of DoD and commercial cloud services in the following areas: • The connection between the CSP’s infrastructure/network and the DISN • CSP service protections and integration into required DODIN cyberspace defense and access control services • Mission system/application protections and integration into required DODIN cyberspace defense and access control services DoD’s usage of commercial cloud services means that the DoD joins an ecosystem of internetconnected CSPs/CSOs. While DoD leverages internet-connected CSOs for the dissemination or processing of public information (Level 2), DoD also leverages private connectivity to the same CSOs for the protection of sensitive DoD information i.e., CUI at levels 4 and 5. Additionally, DoD mission partners that are not native to NIPRNet will need to leverage internet-connected CSOs for their level 4/5 processing (possibly under waiver) or will need to implement their own private connectivity.  Figure 5-8: NIPRNet/commercial/federal cloud ecosystem shows the overall architecture of the cloud ecosystem into which NIPRNet is connected that consists of off-premises, non-DoDprivate commercial and federal CSPs/CSOs. Any of the CSP/CSO clouds in the diagram may be a commercial CSO or a CSO operated/offered by a non-DoD federal agency. The point of this diagram is to make it clear that every non-DoD-private commercial and/or federal CSP/CSO is accessible from the internet even if the CSO has a level 4/5 PA and is connected to NIPRNet via private connections. It also demonstrates that these CSPs/CSOs support non-DoD customers. This figure focuses on NIPRNet connectivity to commercial/federal CSOs for the majority of mission use cases. It does not show all possible situations or use cases. Additional figures may be provided in future releases of the CC SRG.		
5.10.1								Cloud Access Point (CAP) The concept of and requirement for a cloud access point (CAP) is derived from NSA and DoD cybersecurity team guidance as presented in the DoD CIO’s DoD Cloud Way Forward, v1, 23 July 201473 document which provides for a security stack/CAP for both off-premises and onpremises commercially owned and operated CSOs. This concept was made policy by the 15 December 2014 DoD CIO memo regarding Updated Guidance on the Acquisition and Use of Commercial Cloud Computing Services, which states “commercial cloud services used for sensitive data must be connected to customers through a Cloud Access Point (CAP).” This CC SRG expands upon the concept and adjusts the requirement for on-premises vs off-premises CSOs. For the purpose of this SRG, sensitive data as referenced in the DoD CIO memo means CUI as handled at levels 4/5 or classified information up to Secret as handled at Level 6. In general, a CAP is required to mitigate risks to the DISN (or other DoD network74) posed by connecting commercial CSOs to it except under certain restrictions. A CAP is a system of network boundary protection and monitoring devices (e.g., firewall, IPS, IDS, proxy, etc.), otherwise known as a cybersecurity or IA stack, through which CSP infrastructure and networks will connect to the network the CAP protects. This CC SRG addresses the DISN as the protected network which includes NIPRNet, SIPRNet, and other DISN-based mission partner/community of interest (COI) networks. The primary purpose of a CAP is the protection of the DoD network from, and detection of, unauthorized network access from the CSP’s infrastructure, CSO management plane, CSP’s corporate networks, CSP’s connections to the internet, and unauthorized traffic generated from compromised mission owner systems/applications and virtual networks. The secondary purpose is the protection of the DODIN (i.e., DoD information) in general by facilitating protected connections for network users to access level 4/5 or 6 mission owner systems/applications instantiated on IaaS/PaaS, or using SaaS, and the information stored and processed therein, without exposing such traffic to the internet. These purposes also apply to any CAP on any other DoD network, mission partner, or COI network for the protection of those networks and the sensitive information they contain. NOTICE: a CAP does not protect the cloud-based application or the network enclave (physical or virtual) in which it resides. Each mission owner having control over what is built in the application’s virtual environment in I/PaaS, must provide for the protection of their application and virtual network enclave. In the case of CSOs such as P/SaaS where the mission owner does not have control over what is built in the P/IaaS application’s environment, the CSP is responsible for the protection of the application and the network enclave (physical or virtual) in which the application resides. CAP architecture will change depending on whether the CSO infrastructure is on-premises or off-premises and the services transiting it. The concepts of internal CAPs (ICAPs) for on premises CSOs and boundary CAPs (BCAPs) for off-premises CSOs are detailed below with a focus on how these are implemented to protect the DISN. Some CAPs will leverage existing infrastructure and some will be a new capability. CAP architecture may also change depending on the DODIN network, or COI network it is protecting. The basic capabilities that any CAP must provide in support of DODIN cyber defenses are as follows: • A firewall capability that will only permit inbound (to DISN) responses to outbound (from DISN) requests to the CSO (all permitted) while denying all traffic originating in the CSO or its management plane except for specifically authorized traffic from the CSO to specific DoD endpoints on the DISN (permit by exception, deny by default). This will address the potential for unauthorized DODIN/DISN access from the CSO management plane or from a compromised CSO. • An intrusion detection (IDS) capability to detect firewall failure, unauthorized traffic, and malware or other malicious traffic conveyed in unencrypted traffic. • In the event Voice and/or Video over IP (VVoIP) traffic consisting of the SIP-TLS and SRTP protocols (or their unsecure versions which is not permitted) traverse the CAP, a session border controller (SBC) capability must be implemented. The SBC capability must be implemented in a back-to-back-SIP user agent/proxy mode so a TCP/UDP port is not statically opened inbound signaling. The SBC capability must also dynamically manage the randomly selected ephemeral UDP ports for media (SRTP) such that these IP ports are only opened for the duration of the communications session. Additionally, the SBC capability must act as a SIP/SRTP IDS to detect and report unauthorized activities, malformed/dropped packets, etc. Note: All of the above capabilities must provide feeds to the DODIN boundary cyber defense capabilities such that anomalies can be detected and correlated with other anomalies on the network and ISs. The remainder of this section will define the CAP requirements for DISN connected CSOs. These concepts can also be applied to other networks that do not use DISN Transport and are not behind the DISN IAPs. Corresponding Security Controls: SC-7, SC-7(3), SC-7(4)	SC-7,SC-7 (3),SC-7 (4)	
5.10.1.1								Boundary CAP (BCAP) Level 4/5 A Boundary CAP (BCAP) is required to connect off-premises non-DoD (commercially or governmentally) owned and operated CSOs to the DISN (or other DoD networks). A BCAP will interconnect the network it protects with multiple CSP networks that offer private connectivity services. A BCAP does not provide direct internet access to or from CSP CSOs, the mission applications built upon them, or network users. Refer to Figure 5-9: Notional Connectivity Off-Premises Non-Private Non-DoD CSOs (Commercial/Federal) (NIPRNet IL4/5) at the end of this subsection for a graphic representation of the topics discussed in this subsection and its subsections.  In general, a BCAP will provide the following protections: • Provides DISN perimeter defenses and cyber defense sensing for traffic to and from applications hosted in the CSO. • Protects the DODIN (i.e., DoD missions and information within the DISN) along with the DISN and its network services from incidents that affect a particular CSP's infrastructure or supported missions. • Protects DoD systems/applications instantiated in one CSP's infrastructure from incidents that affect a different CSP's infrastructure or supported missions. A DISN BCAP is a DISN boundary intended to protect the enclave and information system which is the DISN and its other interconnected enclaves. The DISN is on the inside or protected side of the boundary. Likewise, mission owner systems/applications implemented in I/PaaS or using P/SaaS are considered enclaves which require enclave boundary and demilitarized zone (DMZ) protections (alternate solutions will be considered on a case-by-case basis). These are on the outside or unprotected side of the boundary. As such mission owner systems/applications implemented in I/PaaS as well as P/SaaS applications must protect themselves. This must be accomplished as close to the application enclave boundary as possible. Multiple mission owner systems/applications implemented in IaaS and PaaS where the mission owner has control over the VMs and environment must include virtual enclave boundary and DMZ protections for their application or they can be protected by a Virtual Datacenter Security Stack (VDSS) and managed through a Virtual Datacenter Management Suite (VDMS) as described in the Secure Cloud Computing Architecture (SCCA) Functional Requirements Document (FRD)75. Mission owner use of PaaS or SaaS where the mission owner does not have control over the VMs and environment, must rely on the enclave boundary and DMZ protections afforded by the CSP for their CSO or leverage an alternative solution (e.g., a third-party CSO such as a cloud access security broker (CASB) service having minimally a FedRAMP moderate PA). Note: P/SaaS CSOs are typically connected to the internet, thus must have enclave boundary and DMZ protections within their infrastructure to protect their customer’s data from internet threats. DoD trusts that this is the case and validates it though the FedRAMP P-ATO and DoD PA processes. 		
5.10.1.1.1								NIPRNet BCAP The primary purpose of the NIPRNet BCAP is to protect the NIPRNet from the CSPs/CSOs and to provide private connectivity to the CSP’s networks from the NIPRNet in support of NIPRNet user connectivity to IL4/5 Cloud-based applications and services. The implementation of the DISN BCAP capability for NIPRNet is ultimately a DISA responsibility as part of its mission to protect the DODIN and DoD information. Per the 15 December 2014 DoD CIO memo, initial capability may temporarily be provided by DoD Components other than DISA, as approved by the DoD CIO, while the intent is for DISA to implement DISN BCAPs as an enterprise wide DISN service. This requirement is applicable to Boundary CAPs to the NIPRNet, not ICAPs. Specific CAP architectural requirements are beyond the scope of this SRG and will be published separately in the SCCA FR document. The NIPRNet BCAP must be implemented as a system of hyper redundant, dual homed, geographically disbursed, high availability, high capacity cybersecurity stacks, and meet-me points so that the BCAP system can handle the throughput required to handle all the applications expected to migrate to commercial Cloud. It provides connectivity between DISN users and multiple off-premises level 4/5 CSOs. It also facilitates user connections to these CSOs from the internet through the DISN IAPs for internet-facing applications (IFAs). 		
5.10.1.1.1-Impact_level_2								The NIPRNet BCAP is not used since off-premises CSP infrastructure having a level 2 PA is directly connected to the internet, all traffic to and from a level 2 CSO serving level 2 missions and their mission virtual networks will connect via the internet. NIPRNet users access these CSOs and applications via the DISN IAPs while internet-based users access them directly. Mission owner applications implemented in I/PaaS CSOs where the mission owner has control over the environment must provide their own enclave boundary and DMZ application protections or leverage an enterprise level application protection service (i.e., the Virtual Datacenter Security Stack (VDSS)/Virtual Datacenter Management Suite (VDMS) portion of the SCCA) instantiated within the same CSO. VDSS/VDMS may be provided by DISA, a DoD component, or the mission owner. SaaS CSOs must provide their own enclave boundary and DMZ application protections to which a mission owner may layer on additional protection services (e.g., CASB). Refer to Sections 5.10.2.2, User/Data Plane Connectivity and 5.10.2.3, Management Plane Connectivity for additional details. Alternately Level 2 IFAs may be implemented in a Level 4/5 CSO thus will connect either to the internet directly or through the IAPs and NIPRNet BCAP. Refer to Impact Levels 4/5 below. Note: All IFAs providing access to publicly released information along with some IFAs providing access to low confidentiality private information should migrate to a Level 2 CSO rather than a level 4 or 5 CSO. This will not only reduce the load and required capacity on the BCAP infrastructure and IAPs but will also reduce the attack surface of the NIPRNet and will permit the DoD components and department to realize the greatest cost savings and support other mandated cost saving initiatives.		
5.10.1.1.1-Impact_levels_45								Except as approved (waivered) by DoD CIO, all DoD traffic from NIPRNet (or other DISN-based COI network) to and from off-premises CSP infrastructure serving level 4 and level 5 missions and the mission virtual networks must traverse one or more NIPRNet BCAPs. No direct IL4/5 traffic is permitted to/from the internet except via the NIPRNet IAPs and DMZ capabilities provided by the mission owner, a DoD component, or DISA. The BCAP or an attached meet-me point provides for direct physical or logical connectivity between the DISN and CSP’s network through which the CSO is accessed. Physical connectivity is established using a direct fiber optic connection between the DISN meet-me point router and a nearby CSP network router. Logical connectivity is established using dedicated long-haul circuits, Private IP VPN services, a FedRAMP authorized multi-CSP/customer interconnection service, or a point-to-point IPsec VPN. These connections can also support the transport of IPsec VPNs connections originating within the CSP’s network infrastructure and/or mission owner’s virtual networks. This includes the production plane for non-privileged user access and the management plane for privileged user access and deployed IA/cybersecurity defense tool connectivity to internal DISN native cybersecurity defense monitoring systems. Refer to Sections 5.10.2.2, User/Data Plane Connectivity and 5.10.2.3, Management Plane Connectivity for additional details. High availability mission owner systems and their supporting CSP network infrastructure must connect through two or more NIPRNet BCAPs. The NIPRNet BCAP will also provide the following functions: • Serves as an authorized DoD DMZ for IFAs and mission systems in level 4/5 CSOs providing the DISN facing DoD IP addresses used by the mission system/application are authorized DoD DMZ IP addresses. Mission owner applications in I/PaaS must provide their own DMZ application protections or leveraging an enterprise level application protection service (i.e., the Virtual Datacenter Security Stack (VDSS)/Virtual Datacenter Management Suite (VDMS) portion of the SCCA) provided by DISA or a DoD component in the cloud. A BCAP does not support/provide direct internet access to a level 4/5 CSO. Such access must be via the NIPRNet IAPs. • May terminate physical or logical connections from the internal side of a DoD Component’s DMZ such that the DoD component’s existing DMZ protections may be leveraged for their IFAs. NOTICE: Level 5 CSP/CSO infrastructure/applications and DoD mission owner applications must be designed such that there is no dependence on internet-based resources such that traffic must traverse the IAPs to/from the internet to make the CSO function. As such the CSO and DoD mission owner applications connected through a BCAP must be able to fully function; serving NIPRNet connected users in the event DoD decides to cut off NIPRNet access to the internet. In this situation, internet-connected users will not be able to use the level 5 service/resource. Mission owners that need this restriction for level 4 CSOs must add the requirement to their SLA/contract. Note: It is recognized that certain missions that handle CUI (i.e., IL4/5 applications) primarily support internet-based users rather than NIPRNet based users. As such, it might be advantageous for the mission owners of such applications to seek DoD CIO approval (waiver) to host their application and information in a CSO with a DoD IL4/5 PA, but to connect it directly to the internet rather than forcing their internet user traffic through the IAPs and BCAP. If approved, the mission owner must protect their application and information IAW the protection defined above for IL2 applications. 		
5.10.1.1.2								NIPRNet BCAP Meet-Me Points A NIPRNet BCAP Meet-Me Point is a DISN point-of-presence (PoP) located in a carrier agnostic commercial network interconnection facility or commercial carrier’s collocation facility. This PoP minimally consists of a high capacity router but may include DISN boundary protection capabilities that constitute all or part of the BCAP cybersecurity stack. The purpose of the BCAP meet-me point is to facilitate the interconnection of the DISN BCAP with multiple CSP networks. Multiple BCAP meet-me points will be implemented to facilitate redundant and reliable interconnection with CSP networks. BCAP meet-ne points will be geographically disbursed in U.S. jurisdiction to facilitate connection availability and to reduce latency between the users and CSO. The BCAP and/or meet-me points may also support interconnection with commercial carrier grade services that provide cloud customer network access/connection to multiple CSP networks (e.g., Equinix Cloud Exchange, AT&T NetBond, and Verizon Secure Cloud Interconnect). The use of such networks requires that the service be authorized by DoD in advance. Since the meet-me point is a DISN PoP located in a commercial facility, the following requirements apply. A BCAP meet-me point/DISN PoP located in a commercial facility: • Must be located in a physically separate protected space within the commercial facility such as in a locked cage or minimally in a locked cabinet. • The physically separate space is minimally protected as follows: o Physical access to the commercial facility is compliant with all required physical environment and maintenance personnel access security controls in the FedRAMP moderate or high baseline (PE and MA families) as appropriate to include but not limited to role-based access control, access auditing, visitor access logging and escorting as needed, etc. o Physical access to the DoD space is compliant with all required physical and maintenance personnel access security controls in the FedRAMP moderate baseline or high baseline as appropriate and/or appropriate CNSSI 1253 baselines to include but not limited to role-based access control, access auditing, visitor access logging and escorting as needed, etc. o Personnel access to the DoD space is controlled by an automated entry access control system (AECS) that is token and/or biometric based. This system may be under DoD control or under the control of the facility owner, but must limit access to only authorized individuals, must log/audit all accesses to include the identities of the personnel accessing and departing, and must provide and log alerts for unauthorized accesses and failed attempts. o Access to the physical space is externally monitored by the facility owner using video cameras and physical intrusion detection system (IDS) alarm systems. o It is highly recommended that the internal space be monitored by an automated motion IDS system and video cameras operated by DoD. In this manner DoD can monitor all physical activities within the space, authorized or unauthorized. • Must be compliant with DoD SRGs and STIGs. • Must follow a change management and connection approval process that documents all aspects of approved connections and system modification • All connections are assigned a command communications service designator (CCSD) for tracking and authorization purposes  • Must be assessed and authorized under DoD RMF as part of the BCAP and DISN accreditation due to its role as an extension of the DISN authorization boundary. 		
5.10.1.1.3								CSP Support for BCAP Connectivity To support BCAP connections between DoD and an off-premises level 4/5 CSP, the CSP must offer a private connection service to the CSO that does not traverse the internet. The CSP’s network must include a PoP in a carrier agnostic commercial network interconnection facility or commercial carrier’s collocation facility where an existing DISN PoP/BCAP meet-me-point is located. A physical connection within the facility will be installed between the two PoPs providing a direct private connection between the DISN BCAP and the CSP’s network over which the CSO will be accessed along with supporting services. In the event reliability is a requirement for access to the CSO the interconnections must be implemented minimally in two geographically disbursed network interconnection/collocation facilities. As a condition for a DoD level 4 or level 5 PA the CSP must offer the private connection service for access to the CSO. DoD recognizes that the CSP may not have one or more PoPs collocated with a DISN BCAP meet-me-point. As such the existence of such a CSP network PoP will not be required for obtaining the PA but a willingness to install such a PoP or to negotiate a mutually agreeable location for collocating the DISN and CSP PoPs, or use an approved intermediary cloud interconnection service (having its own DoD PA). Associated costs will be negotiated between the mission owner and CSP. If a new DISN meet-me PoP is required; DISA must be included in such negotiations. Notice of this potential situation must be provided during the PA assessment phase. Such negotiations will occur in the planning stage for the BCAP connection based on a contract between the CSP and their first mission owner. Mission owners may also stipulate that the CSP must have/install a PoP collocated with one or more DISN meet-mepoints. 		
5.10.1.1.4								CSP/CSO Network Connectivity to Internet and BCAP Section 5.10, Architecture, and Figure 5-8: NIPRNet/Commercial/Federal Cloud Ecosystem, depict the reality that CSPs/CSOs having a level 4/5 PA that are connected to the NIPRNet via a NIPRNet BCAP are also connected to the internet. As a condition for a DoD level 4 or level 5 PA the CSP, when the CSP’s network which supports a DoD contracted CSO is privately connected to the NIPRNet via a NIPRNet BCAP (or other DoD network via their BCAP) and the internet, the CSP must provide evidence that the CSP’s network or the CSO cannot provide a path from the internet to the NIPRNet (or other network), thus creating a back door to a DoD network. An additional or associated consideration is the robustness of the CSP’s required boundary protection (defense-in-depth security/protective measures) implemented between the internet and the CSO for its protection from internet-based threats. This protection is expected to be different depending on whether the CSO is I/PaaS or P/SaaS and whether the mission owner has control over their portion of the CSO. Refer to Section 5.10.3, CSP Service Architecture, and Section 5.10.6, Mission Owner System/Application Requirements Using IaaS/PaaS, for details. Figure 5-9 notionally depicts the method by which off-premises, non-private, non-DoD CSOs are connected to NIPRNet and other networks as well as how various user communities access the CSO. It supports the topics discussed in Section 5.10.1.1 and its subsections. The following are important takeaways from the diagram: • The CSP’s network through which the CSO is accessed is connected to NIPRNet through the BCAP and meet-me points creating a private connection. This connection is typically a fiber jumper between the meet-me router and the CSP’s network router. This connection may optionally be made via an authorized cloud inter-connect service providing access to multiple CSP’s CSOs. • The CSP’s CSO will be connected to the internet to support connections from Non-DoD customers of the CSO. These customers may optionally connect via their own private connections. If public users are supported, they will connect via this internet connection. • The CSP’s CSO will be managed from the CSP’s management plane which may be connected to the CSP’s corporate network, one or both of which will have one or more connections to the internet. Both of these may extend worldwide touching multiple locations/CSO instances and other CSOs. • NIPRNet users accessing DoD services from the internet including those based in the cloud will VPN into the NIPRNet to access these services.  • Non-DoD and public users accessing DoD IFAs from the internet will do so via the IAPs (and DoD DMZ as applicable). This includes authenticated users of DoD IFAs. Direct internet access is only permitted under DoD CIO approval (CAP waiver). • Non-DoD mission partner networks accessing DoD services, whether cloud based or not, access the NIPRNet via the NIPRNet federal/mission partner gateway(s). Access to the CSO for their own use will be the same as the non-DoD customer’s network. 		
5.10.1.2								Internal CAP (ICAP)		
5.10.1.2-Impact_levels_245								Internal CAPs (ICAPs) will be implemented for on-premises commercially owned and operated CSO connectivity to the DISN, if the CSO management plane has connectivity to external networks that bypasses native NIPRNet enclave and external boundary (IAP) protections. As such all NIPRNet (or other unclassified COI network) production traffic to and from on-premises commercially owned and operated CSP infrastructure serving Level 2, 4 and 5 missions and the mission virtual networks must traverse an ICAP. An ICAP is a DISN boundary consisting of a cybersecurity stack that protects the DISN (or other DoD network) or the datacenter network to which the CSO is connected (inside/protected side of the boundary) from, and provides detection of, unauthorized network access from the CSP’s infrastructure (outside/unprotected side of the boundary), externally connected CSO management plane, CSP corporate networks, CSP connections to the internet, and from compromised mission owner systems/applications and virtual networks. Typically, one ICAP is required for each physical CSO infrastructure instance. An ICAP is required to mitigate vulnerabilities and risks associated with implementing a commercial CSP’s CSO infrastructure on-premises (i.e., located inside the B/C/P/S physical or virtual “fence-line.”) when, as expected, that infrastructure is managed by the CSP from their off-premises corporate CSO management centers using non-DoD controlled workstations and infrastructure which will most likely have some connectivity to the CSP's corporate network and/or the internet. The connection between the CSO management centers and the on-premises CSO’s management plane is expected to traverse an IPsec tunnel across NIPRNet, its IAPs, and internet OR traverse a dedicated “side-door” connection using a dedicated circuit, a commercial carrier's Private IP VPN service, or restricted internet service provider (ISP) connection. ISP connections, across which the CSP must VPN, must not provide inbound or outbound access to/from CSO management plane to/from the open internet. This requirement also applies if the CSO management plane is locally dedicated to the CSO and managed on-premises, but with an external connection to the CSP’s corporate network, or similar. The ICAP will be configured to pass authorized production traffic (i.e., required protocols and services on their approved IP Ports) for those mission applications using the CSO while blocking all access to DISN or the datacenter network to which the CSO is connected from the CSO management plane. The architecture of ICAPs may vary and will be developed based upon the location of the CSO infrastructure on the BCPS, existing infrastructure, and other factors. An ICAP minimally consists of a firewall and IDS functions but may leverage current capabilities in the cybersecurity stack, Joint Regional Security Stack (JRSS), or future technology such as JIE core data center.  On the other hand, an ICAP may have special capabilities to support specific missions, CSP types (commercial or DoD), or specific cloud services. Since the CSP infrastructure and ICAP are both on-premises directly connected to the NIPRNet or indirectly via a DoD data center network, the full suite of BCAP boundary protections are not needed. When using the cybersecurity stack protecting a DoD data center today (e.g., DECC) or JIE core data center in the future as an ICAP, the CSO must be connected in such a manner that both the DISN and datacenter network are protected from the CSO management plane. ICAP implementation and the connection of on-premises CSP infrastructure to the NIPRNet will follow normal NIPRNet connection approval guidance and requirements as is the case with any NIPRNet enclave or application infrastructure in a DoD data center. An ICAP is not required in the event the CSO is managed under the following conditions: • The CSO management plane is a closed network directly part of the CSO infrastructure having no side-door or back-door connections to non-DISN networks. OR • The CSO management plane is a NIPRNet enclave or part of one which only has connectivity to external networks such as the internet or CSP corporate network via, and visible to, the native NIPRNet boundary protections and IAPs. While CSP personnel may VPN to their corporate network from their workstation, a point-to-point VPN may not be established between the CSP’s network and the CSO management plane. The latter will require the establishment of an ICAP. Additionally: • CSP personnel manage the CSO from a location on a DoD installation/BCPS. • The CSP personnel are issued GFE from which they perform their CSO management duties if these workstations can access the NIPRNet. • CSP personnel may not use the same GFE to manage the CSO as is used to perform general business functions such as email or those that might require surfing the internet. • The CSP personnel are issued CAC cards for installation/BCPS access and access to their GFE and NIPRNet. Figure 5-10 notionally depicts the method by which on-premises DoD private CSO infrastructure is connected to NIPRNet when the CSO is managed from a contractor’s off-premises management plane. This may apply to COCO or GOCO CSO infrastructures. It supports the topics discussed in Section 5.10.1.2. The following are important takeaways from the diagram: • If the on-premises (private) CSO infrastructure is managed from an off-premises nonNIPRNet CSO management plane or contractor enclave an ICAP is required. This is due to the likely connection to a corporate network, both of which may have one or more connections to the internet. • Connection from the off-premises CSO management plane to the CSO infrastructure may be via an encrypted tunnel that traverses the IAP, NIPRNet, data center boundary (if inline), and the ICAP, OR via a direct “side door” connection (i, e., direct circuit or dedicated ISP connection). • NIPRNet users accessing DoD services from the internet including those based in the cloud will VPN into the NIPRNet to access these services. • Non-DoD and public users accessing DoD IFAs from the internet will do so via the IAPs (and DoD DMZ as applicable). This includes authenticated users of DoD IFAs. • Non-DoD mission partner networks accessing DoD services, whether cloud based or not, access the NIPRNet via the NIPRNet Federal/Mission Partner gateway(s). Access to the CSO for their own use will be the same as the Non-DoD customer’s network.  Figure 5-11 notionally depicts the method by which on-premises DoD private CSO infrastructure is connected to NIPRNet when the CSO is managed from an on-premises management plane. This is in contrast to being managed from an off-premises management plane. The following are important takeaways from the diagram: • ICAP is not needed if CSO management is performed from an on-premises NIPRNet enclave. • (Not depicted) In the event the CSO infrastructure is directly connected to the NIPRNet, a datacenter enclave boundary must be provided. 		
5.10.1.3								Virtually On-Premises Architecture NIPRNet Level 4/5 The virtually on-premises concept is discussed above in Section 5.2.1.1, DoD Off-Premises vs. On-Premises vs. Virtually On-Premises. Figure 5-12 provides the graphical depiction of the architecture.  Figure 5-12 notionally depicts the method by which a virtually on-premises architecture can be achieved. The following are important takeaways from the diagram: • The CSO infrastructure is DoD private in a closed NIPRNet enclave that is off-premises. • DISN transport is extended to this enclave optionally via a meet-me point. The use of a meet-me point may invoke additional traffic separation requirements depending on the specific off-premises location in relation to the meet-me location and if the hosting parties’ network is used. • The CSO network enclave is protected with DoD NIPRNet datacenter enclave protections or equivalent to include enclave firewall and ID/PS. • The DoD private CSO infrastructure is managed from the same or another properly protected NIPRNet enclave. • No management of the private CSO infrastructure may be performed from the CSP’s management plane used for any other CSO offered. No such connection is permitted in this scenario. Any connection between the private CSO infrastructure and a non-dedicated management plane enclave negates the virtually on-premises construct and requires the connection to the NIPRNet to traverse a BCAP.		
5.10.1.4								SIPRNet ICAP In accordance with CNSS architectural recommendations for the National Secret Fabric, DoD Secret enclaves and virtual networks instantiated in DoD on-premises impact level 6 CSOs will be considered as an enclave within the DoD provider network, (i.e., the SIPRNet). Since DoD on/off-premises impact level 6 CSOs and their supporting infrastructure, to include management network(s) are required to be one or more closed SIPRNet enclaves, they can be considered to be on-premises (physically or virtually) for the purposes of this CC SRG due to the concept of extending the virtual “fence-line” or SIPRNet boundary around such DoD enclaves. As such these enclaves must comply with all SIPRNet connection approval requirements which include the appropriate enclave boundary protections and cyberspace defense requirements. The DoD mission owner systems/applications instantiated in these impact level 6 CSO enclaves will be assessed and authorized the same way any other DoD SIPRNet enclave connection ICAPS are required as they are for NIPRNet connections to CSOs. The following diagrams depict the SIPRNet architectures for connecting CSOs and their management enclaves to SIPRNet. Figure 5-13 notionally depicts the method by which an on-premises IL6 CSO would be connected to SIPRNet. The following are important takeaways from the diagram: • The management plane is also on SIPRNet within the same or another SIPRNet enclave. • ICAP is required. • Non-DoD mission partners or other federal agencies will access the CSO via the SIPRNet mission partner gateway. • In the event the CSO is managed from a SIPRNet enclave not collocated with the CSO infrastructure, connections to the CSO will be via the SIPRNet mission partner gateway or the CSP may institute a private connection using black transport.		
5.10.1.5								Mission Partner Environments or Communities of Interest Network Cloud Access Points For the purpose of this CC SRG, mission partner refers to DoD components, federal agencies, and potentially their contractors operating networks that include DoD and other entities. This section does not include or refer to war fighting coalition partners or the networks they use or are implemented for them. Coalition networks may be addressed in a future release of the CC SRG, however the use of cloud computing on these networks should be implemented in the same manner as this CC SRG provides for NIPRNet or SIPRNet to include BCAPs and ICAPs depending on the classification level of the network. Mission partner environments (MPEs) include mission partners that use networks other than NIPRNet or SIPRNet (e.g., DREN) and mission partner communities of interest (COI) that use network overlays and extensions that leverage (e.g., ride on or overlay) the NIPRNet or SIPRNet (e.g., MilCOI). Additionally, DoD component mission partners (e.g., commissaries; exchanges; morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) organizations; non-appropriated fund (NAF) organizations; educational entities (e.g., National Defense University (NDU)) typically operate networks that may not be part of the DISN (i.e., do not use DISN transport or NIPRNet services such as internet access via the NIPRNet IAPs) or .mil domain. These mission partners and their networks may be in the .gov/.org/.com/.edu domains and may be directly accessed from the internet through a boundary similar to a DoD IAP which they operate and authorize or a contracted third-party DHS/GSA trusted internet connection (TIC). Such other networks and COI may interconnect with NIPRNet or SIPRNet and may interconnect with other DoD and Non-DoD mission partner/agency networks. While the CAP concepts presented here are applicable to non-native DISN networks operated by other DoD components (e.g., the .edu community which supports a diverse non-DoD user base) there may be other methods of protecting these networks from risks associated with the use of commercial cloud. The use of a cloud access security broker (CASB) service having minimally a FedRAMP moderate PA might be one such alternative for non-DISN networks. MPEs that use network(s) other than NIPRNet or SIPRNet (e.g., DRSN), will need to implement BCAPs or ICAPs for those network(s) that provide equivalent protections to those defined in the SCCA Functional Requirements Document (FRD)76 when connecting CSP infrastructure to their networks. MPEs implemented as a COI overlay on NIPRNet or SIPRNet can use the DISAprovided CAPs to fulfill the CAP requirement or may provide their own CAP capability IAW the SCCA. Mission partners that are external to NIPRNet or SIPRNet, however, are responsible for providing an equivalent capability to protect DoD data and MPEs from vulnerabilities associated with a connection to an external service provider. All MPE CAP instantiations must be approved by the DoD CIO. Note: MPE network connectivity/access to off-premises commercial DoD level 4/5 CSOs will not traverse a NIPRNet BCAP or a NIPRNet federated gateway (NFG) when connecting to/accessing MPE applications instantiated in such a CSO.		
5.10.1.6								Mission Partner Environment Access to NIPRNet Services Hosted in the Cloud Mission partner environments that require access to NIPRNet services are required to connect to NIPRNet via the internet, IAPs, and DoD DMZ or via a NIPRNet federated gateway (NFG) IAW JFHQ-DODIN TASKORD 16-0103 Establishment of the NIPRNET federated gateway (NFG). NIPRNet services are applications operated by DoD components for the purpose of serving NIPRNet users. Some of these NIPRNet focused applications might be implemented in a CSO. Such a CSO might be commercial off-premises CSO, a DoD private off-premises CSO, or a DoD private on-premises CSO. Mission partners that desire or require access to such applications must coordinate with the mission owner of the application for permission to access it and to determine the best access method. There are three approved methods of accessing such an application as follows: • The MPE user must establish a VPN connection to NIPRNet or the application itself. • The mission owner must expose the application to the internet through the DoD DMZ such that the MPE user can access the application from the internet via the IAPs. • The mission owner must expose the application to the MPE network and MPE users through the NFG. 		
5.10.1.7								Mission System Connection Approval through DISN BCAPs		
5.10.1.7-Impact_levels_45								Connection of a mission system to the DISN via an ICAP or BCAP will be approved and recorded by the DISA Connection Approval Office in accordance with normal connection approval procedures. This requires all mission owners to register all cloud based applications, their CSP/CSO, and connection method in the DISA Systems/Network Approval Process (SNAP)77 database cloud module. Initial connections (physical or virtual) to a CSP’s network will occur during onboarding of the CSP’s first mission owner customer. Additional connections will be made or capacity will be scaled as more mission owners use the given CSP. Specific processes and procedures regarding connection approval and mission owner connections via a BCAP are addressed in the DISA Cloud Connection Process Guide (CCPG)78 which will ultimately be merged with the overall DISN Connection Process Guide (CPG)79.		
5.10.1.7-Impact_level_6								The DoD mission owner systems/applications instantiated in these impact level 6 CSO enclaves will be assessed and authorized the same way any other DoD SIPRNet enclave connection IAW the DISA CPG. Approval for connection to the SIPRNet will be processed through the DISA classified connection approval process like any other SIPRNet enclave.		
5.10.2								Network Planes A plane, in a networking context, is one of three integral components of network architectures. These three elements – the data synchronization/control or network plane, the user/data or production plane, and the management plane – can be thought of as different areas of operations. Each plane carries a different type of traffic and is conceptually an overlay network on top of the network plane.		
5.10.2.1								Network Plane Connectivity The network or data sync/control plane carries signaling traffic and data replication between servers/data centers. Network control packets originate from or are destined for a network transport device (virtual or physical). The network plane in general is subject to network related DoD SRGs and STIGs. This CC SRG does not contain additional requirements related to network plane connections to the cloud computing infrastructure.		
5.10.2.2								User/Data Plane Connectivity The user/data plane (also known as the forwarding plane, carrier plane, or bearer plane) carries the network user traffic. Table 5-4 details the DoD user/data plane connectivity by impact level for DoD on-premises and off-premises CSOs. Note: While this table does apply to non-DoD federal government tenants using a DoD onpremises CSO, it does not apply to non-DoD federal government tenants using an off-premises CSO that is a federal government community cloud having DoD tenants.		
Table 5-4	Impact Level 2							Off-Premises Non-DoD CSP Service Offering Infrastructure  User connectivity will leverage commercial infrastructure (i.e., internet).  Users connecting from the internet will connect directly while users connecting from inside the DISN (i.e., NIPRNet) will connect to the internet via the DISN IAPs and then to the CSP infrastructure.  CSO connections will be assessed and authorized using the same external connection requirements as any other internet-facing connection. On-Premises DoD and Non-DoD CSP Service Offering Infrastructure  User connectivity will use existing infrastructure (Government owned) for its user/data plane when the user is within the B/P/C/S fence-line (onpremises) and directly connected to the local Base Area Network (BAN) and NIPRNet.  User traffic to/from the NIPRNet to/from the CSO infrastructure will traverse an ICAP. When the user is outside the B/P/C/S fence-line (offpremises) connected to the internet, user traffic must enter/leave the NIPRNet via the DISN IAPs and then an ICAP.  CSO connections will be assessed and authorized the same as any other internal connection.		
Table 5-4	Impact Level 4 and 5							Off-Premises Non-DoD CSP Service Offering Infrastructure  DoD and external user connectivity will leverage a DISN extension to the commercial facility using government network infrastructure within government boundaries (i.e., NIPRNet) and commercial infrastructure beyond government boundaries (i.e., commercial carrier infrastructure/connectivity service offerings).  The DISN extension will traverse a BCAP.  Users connecting from inside the DISN (i.e., NIPRNet) will connect via a BCAP while users connecting from the internet will traverse the IAPs then a BCAP. CSO connections will be assessed and authorized through the Connection Approval Process the same as any other internal connection using the same requirements as any other DoD-facing or internet-facing connection. On-Premises DoD and Non-DoD CSP Service Offering Infrastructure  User connectivity will use existing infrastructure (Government owned) for its user/data plane when the user is within the B/P/C/S fence-line (onpremises) and directly connected to the local Base Area Network (BAN) and NIPRNet.  User traffic to/from the NIPRNet to/from the CSO infrastructure will traverse an ICAP. When the user is outside the B/P/C/S fence-line (offpremises) connected to the internet, user traffic must enter/leave the NIPRNet via the DISN IAPs and then an ICAP.  CSO connections will be assessed and authorized the same as any other internal connection.		
Tabel 5-4	Impact Level 6							Off-Premises Non-DoD CSP Service Offering Infrastructure  User connectivity will leverage a DISN extension to the commercial facility using government Secret network infrastructure within government boundaries (i.e., SIPRNet) and commercial infrastructure beyond government boundaries (i.e., commercial carrier infrastructure/connectivity service offerings).  The DISN extension to a commercial facility can be accomplished with a Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) router and optical switch (referred to as a Service Delivery Node).  The DISN extension to a commercial facility will use NSA Type 1 encryption or commercial equivalent (Commercial Solutions for Classified Programs (CSfC)80 Suite B).  User traffic to/from the internet (e.g., executive travel kits users) will use NSA Type 1 encryption or commercial equivalent (CSfC Suite B) and must enter/leave the SIPRNet via the approved gateways. On-Premises DoD and Non-DoD CSP Service Offering Infrastructure  User connectivity will use existing Secret network infrastructure (Government owned) for its user/data plane (i.e., SIPRNet). User traffic to/from the SIPRNet will traverse an ICAP.  User traffic to/from the internet (e.g., executive travel kits users) will use NSA Type 1 encryption or commercial equivalent (CSfC Suite B) and must enter/leave the SIPRNet via the approved gateways.  CSO connections will be assessed and authorized the same as any other internal connection using the same requirements as any other SIPRNet - facing connection.		
5.10.2.3								Management Plane Connectivity The management plane carries network/server/system privileged user (administrator) traffic along with maintenance and monitoring traffic. Table 5-5 details the management plane connectivity by impact level for Mission Owner’s systems/applications and CSP’s CSOs. The mission owner management plane includes connectivity for DoD personnel or DoD contractors managing mission owner systems (i.e., virtual machines and networks) instantiated on IaaS/PaaS as well as for DoD personnel or DoD contractors access to/use of CSP service ordering/management portals for all service offering types (IaaS/PaaS/SaaS). The CSP management plane includes connectivity for CSP personnel managing the CSP’s service offering infrastructure. All encryption identified, except as stated otherwise, must be accomplished using FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 validated cryptography modules operated in FIPS mode. IAW standard practice and security requirements, management interfaces on VMs and protective appliances (virtual or physical) located in a mission owner’s virtual network, must not be exposed to direct access from the production network (e.g., internet or NIPRNet/SIPRNet). To the extent possible, CSP service ordering/management portals through which VMs and virtual networks are instantiated and configured must also be protected from direct access from the production network to prevent compromise of mission systems and DoD information. All management transactions must be audited.		
Table 5-5	Impact Level 2							Mission Owner Management Plane  Management connectivity from outside the NIPRNet (e.g., for offpremises contractor personnel) requires an encrypted, tunneled connection via the internet to the mission system/application and virtual network. Management traffic to CSP service ordering/service management portals must be encrypted if not in an encrypted VPN. Monitoring traffic must traverse a VPN connection. All traffic entering/leaving the NIPRNet must be via the DISN IAPs.  Management connectivity from inside the NIPRNet (e.g., for onpremises DoD or contractor personnel) must be restricted to a defined set of IP addresses and requires an encrypted, tunneled connection through the NIPRNet to the internet via the IAPs to manage the mission system/application and virtual network. Management traffic to CSP service ordering/service management portals must be encrypted if outside an encrypted VPN. Monitoring traffic must traverse a VPN connection. All traffic must enter/leave the NIPRNet via the DISN IAPs. CSP Management Plane  Non-DoD CSP off-premises service offering infrastructure and offpremises management: CSP management connectivity leverages CSP service offering and management plane infrastructure which should be logically or physically separate from production. Note: DoD cannot dictate how a CSP architects their commercial service offerings that are not dedicated to DoD. DoD recommends logical or physical separation of service offering production and management plane infrastructure as a well-known industry best practice. Such separation will be assessed as a bullet point for DoD risk acceptance.  Non-DoD CSP on-premises service offering infrastructure and management: The CSP may directly connect their management infrastructure to their service offering infrastructure if collocated. An encrypted, tunneled connection from the CSP’s on-premises management infrastructure to the service provider’s on-premises service offering infrastructure is also permitted locally but must be used to access remote service offering infrastructure.  Non-DoD CSP on-premises service offering infrastructure and offpremises management: CSP management connectivity must leverage an encrypted, tunneled connection from the CSP’s off-premises management infrastructure to the service provider’s on-premises service offering infrastructure.  DoD CSP on-premises service offering infrastructure and management: CSP management connectivity will use existing infrastructure such as the Enterprise Services Directorate (ESD) Out of Band (OOB) management network. No service provider security stack is required.		
Table 5-5	Impact Level 4 and 5							Mission Owner Management Plane  Management connectivity from inside the NIPRNet must be restricted to a defined set of IP addresses and requires an encrypted, tunneled connection through the NIPRNet and an ICAP or BCAP to manage the mission system/application and virtual network. Management traffic to CSP service ordering/service management portals must be encrypted if not in an encrypted VPN. Monitoring traffic must traverse a VPN connection. All traffic must enter/leave the NIPRNet via a BCAP.  Management connectivity by DoD personnel or DoD contractors from outside the NIPRNet must be restricted to a defined set of IP addresses and requires an encrypted, tunneled connection from the Internet via an IAP and an ICAP or BCAP to the mission system/application and virtual network. Per remote administration policy, the remote management terminal must be government furnished equipment (GFE). Management traffic to CSP service ordering/service management portals must be encrypted if outside an encrypted VPN. Monitoring traffic must traverse a VPN connection via a BCAP and NIPRNet. CSP Management Plane  Non-DoD CSP off-premises service offering infrastructure and offpremises management: CSP management connectivity leverages CSP service offering and management plane infrastructure which should be logically or physically separate from production. Note: DoD cannot dictate how a CSP architects their commercial service offerings that are not dedicated to DoD. DoD recommends logical or physical separation of service offering production and management plane infrastructure as a well-known industry best practice. Such separation will be assessed as a bullet point for DoD risk acceptance.  Non-DoD CSP on-premises service offering infrastructure and management: The CSP may directly connect their management infrastructure to their service offering infrastructure if collocated. An encrypted, tunneled connection from the CSP’s on-premises management infrastructure to the service provider’s on-premises service offering infrastructure is also permitted locally but must be used to access remote service offering infrastructure.  Non-DoD CSP on-premises service offering infrastructure and offpremises management: CSP management connectivity must leverage an encrypted, tunneled connection from the CSP’s off-premises management infrastructure to the service provider’s on-premises service offering infrastructure.  DoD CSP on-premises service offering infrastructure and management: CSP management connectivity will use existing infrastructure such as the Enterprise Services Directorate (ESD) Out of Band (OOB) management network. No service provider security stack is required.		
Table 5-5	Impact Level 6							Mission Owner Management Plane  All management and monitoring connectivity is via the SIPRNet. Management and monitoring traffic will be encrypted using FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 validated cryptography81 to accommodate separation for Needto know reasons. CSP Management Plane  DoD CSP on-premises service offering infrastructure and management: CSP management connectivity will use existing Secret network infrastructure such as the Secret Out of Band (OOB) management network. No service provider security stack is required.  Non-DoD CSP on-premises service offering infrastructure and management: The CSP may directly connect their management infrastructure to their service offering infrastructure if personnel are collocated using their SECRET LAN. An encrypted, tunneled connection using FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 validated cryptography over SIPRNet from the CSP’s onpremises management infrastructure to the service provider’s on-premises service offering infrastructure is also permitted and will be used to access remote service offering infrastructure.  Non-DoD CSP on-premises service offering infrastructure and offpremises management: CSP management connectivity must leverage a SIPRNet extension or a DoD approved encrypted, tunneled connection from the CSP’s dedicated Secret off-premises management infrastructure to the service provider’s on-premises service offering infrastructure.  Non-DoD CSP off-premises service offering infrastructure and offpremises management: CSP management connectivity leverages CSP’s dedicated Secret service offering and management plane infrastructure which must be logically or physically separate.		
5.10.3								DoD uses the concept of defense-in-depth when protecting its networks and data/information. This includes, but is not limited to, hardening host OSs and applications, implementing host firewalls and intrusion detection, strong access control, robust auditing of events, while protecting the networks with application layer firewalls, proxies, web content filters, email gateways, intrusion detection/prevention, and a DMZ/gateway architecture, along with robust network traffic monitoring. The concept must not be lost when moving mission owners systems/applications and their data/information to the commercial cloud. As such, if virtualization is used, the above measures must also be used to protect the virtual environment along with the use of hypervisor based firewall/filtering/routing mechanisms or virtual security appliances. This section details the defense-in-depth security concepts and requirements that both CSPs and mission owners must implement to protect DoD data/information and mission systems/applications. DoD recognizes that there are innovative approaches that can be implemented in the virtual environment that may replace some of the defense-in-depth mitigations that have been developed over the years for physical networks and servers. DoD looks forward to evaluating equivalent alternative measures which will be assessed by DISA on a case-by-case basis.		
5.10.3.1								CSP Service Architecture - SaaS Mission owner use of CSP’s SaaS offerings are reliant on the defense-in-depth measures implemented by the CSP for the protection of the service application and the infrastructure that supports it. This includes the protection of all sensitive information stored and processed in the CSP infrastructure. In other words, the mission owner relies on the CSP and the security posture of its SaaS offering for the protection of DoD information. During the ATO assessment process for SaaS offerings, defense-in-depth security/protective measures must be assessed for adequacy and potential risk acceptance by DoD. This may be in addition to assessing security controls. The following guidance is reflected in the Application Security and Development STIG along with other operating system (OS) and application specific STIGs, but is highlighted here to emphasize instances where an authoritative reference (e.g., product-specific STIG) is not available. Due to the normal internet connectivity for CSOs, DoD expects defense-in-depth security/protective measures to be established by the CSP for P/SaaS CSOs where the mission owner does not have control of their infrastructure environment. These are, but are not limited to, the following: • Application Layer and Web application Firewall(s) (properly configured) and intrusion detection and/or prevention protection of the CSP’s infrastructure supporting the SaaS application offering, as well as segmentation (logical or physical) from the CSP’s other offerings and corporate networks. • Application/network tiered architecture which provides “front end” unrestricted/restricted DMZ zones with appropriate protections for internet/externally facing servers and private/ “back end” zones with appropriate protections for application/database servers and other supporting systems/servers. This includes but is not limited to web application firewalls, reverse web proxies, FTP proxies, etc. as necessary for the protection of the application and the customer’s data/information stored/processed within. Note: P/SaaS CSOs in which the mission owner does not have control of their infrastructure environment typically serve NIPRNet users, thus are NIPRNet-facing via the BCAP. It is recognized that some mission owners need a portion of their CSO application to be internet-facing. In such cases, the internet/NIPRNet-facing portion of the application must use a separate web server(s) and IP address(es) from those only facing the NIPRNet such that they can be whitelisted for access via the IAPs for access and protect the NIPRNet facing web server(s). Refer to Sections 5.10.4.1 IP Addressing of CSOs and Mission Owner Systems/Applications and 5.17.2 DoD DMZ Whitelist for additional information. Note: The internet-facing IP addresses will also be available for access from the NIPRNet. • Customer data-at-rest encryption protections using FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic modules operated in FIPS mode where only the mission owner has control of the keys. This requirement addresses the persistent storage of customer data on various media and in databases, not customer data that requires real time processing without retention. If such data is retained, then the retained data storage is persistent. • Customer data-in-transit encryption protections using FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 validated cryptographic modules operated in FIPS mode. This requirement addresses customer data transiting public and private Wide Area Networks (WAN) (i.e., internet, NIPRNet, CSP’s WAN) and Local Area Networks (LANs) from the customer terminal to the CSP’s service offering enclave LAN. Encryption may be native at the protocol level or be at the VPN/tunnel level. This requirement is also applicable to CSP replication of customer data and systems between primary locations and backup Continuity of Operations (COOP)/Disaster Recovery (DR) locations. • Hardening/patching/maintenance of OSs and applications IAW industry standards. DoD SRGs and STIGS or DoD-accepted equivalents must be used if the service is private or community cloud used by DoD. For Information Assurance (IA) Vulnerability Management (IAVM) message compliance, the CSP will be expected to comply with industry best practice by applying patches identified in the CVE that would be referenced in the DoD IAVM message. Innovative alternatives such as implementing a behavioral based or software integrity protection model for all systems may be viable and will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. • Implement PIV/DoD CAC/PKI authentication for all customer user access on all SaaS offerings that process information at impact levels 4 and 5 in accordance with IA-2 (12). This includes regular non-privileged users accessing the service and privileged customer users accessing service ordering/management interfaces/portals. SaaS offerings that process information at impact Level 6 must use the CNSS SIPRNet Token. Alternate authentication measures for those user communities that cannot use the required PKI token will be assessed on a case-by-case basis and may require a waiver. Notes: • Equivalencies to the vulnerability mitigations provided in DoD SRGs and STIGS may be viable and acceptable but must be approved by the DISA AO. • IAVM messages include IA vulnerability alerts (IAVA), IA vulnerability bulletins (IAVB), and technical advisories (TA). For the remainder of this SRG, the term IAVMs will be used to refer to all IAVM message types.		
5.10.3.2								CSP Service Architecture - IaaS/PaaS Mission owners build systems and applications on virtualized infrastructure provided by the CSO under IaaS/PaaS. There must be a clear delineation of responsibility for security between the CSP and the mission owner, which depends on how the CSP presents the security features it supports in the CSO. Under IaaS the mission owner is fully responsible for securing the guest operating systems and applications that they build; the CSP will be responsible for securing the virtualization OS (i.e., hypervisor) and supporting infrastructure. Under PaaS, the mission owner is fully responsible for securing the guest operating systems and the platform applications and applications that they build. Depending upon how the CSP CSO presents the security features it supports in the CSO, the delineation of responsibility may partially shift from the mission owner to the CSP with respect to the guest operating systems and the platform applications. The CSP might take responsibility for securing these areas of a PaaS CSO as part of the core service or as an add-on component. For the purpose of the remainder of Section 5 of this SRG, IaaS and PaaS offerings are generally treated the same with the responsibility of securing the OS and platform applications being that of the mission owner. Mission owners must assess inherited mitigations that the CSP provides to determine that defense-in-depth security/protective requirements are fully met. CSP IaaS and PaaS offerings must support the defense-in-depth security/protective measures that the mission owner must implement to secure the systems and applications that they build on the service offering. These measures are defined in Section 5.10.6, Mission Owner System/Application Requirements using IaaS/PaaS.		
5.10.3.3								CSP Disaster Recovery (DR) - Continuity of Operations (COOP) As a best business practice, CSPs plan for Disaster Recovery (DR) and Continuity of Operations (COOP) and implement their infrastructures to support it. This typically includes geographically separate facilities/data centers. Furthermore, FedRAMP assess several C/CE related to Contingency Planning (i.e., DR and COOP). Data replication between CSP geographically separate facilities/data centers is typically required for disaster recovery (DR) and/or continuity of operations (COOP) which includes backup. All Data replication must traverse a CSP’s private internal network (physical or virtual) from CSP offering site/location to the DR/COOP facility and protect the data in transit. If this network traverses the internet, the network connection must be encrypted end-to-end in an IPsec tunnel implemented using FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 validated cryptography. Separation requirements implemented in the CSO between DoD data and non-DoD data at the CSP offering site/location must be replicated at the DR/COOP facility. Such separation is not specifically required in transit unless its implementation is required to support separation at the endpoint facilities. Note: For level 4/5 CSOs such transfers do not route through the DISN BCAP unless the DR/COOP facility is on-premises or is another CSP’s CSO. Related Controls: CP-6, CP-7, CP-9	CP-6,CP-7,CP-9	
5.10.4								Internet Protocol (IP) Addressing and Domain Name Services (DNS) DoDI 8410.01, Internet Domain Name Use and Approval, 4 December, 201582 provides DoD policy on the use of Top Level Domain (TLD) names by DoD organizations, their ISs and networks. DoDI 8410.01 requires DoD to conduct DoD public and private internet-based communications (e.g., electronic mail and Web operations) under the TLD established for the DoD—the .mil TLD”. Exceptions are provided for some DoD organizations which may use the .gov, .edu, and .com domains if necessary and approved by the mission owner’s CIO. This means that the end user accessing a DoD website or other resource using a URL will see “.mil” at the end of the URL (e.g., name.mil is required vs name.com). DoDI 8410.01 additionally requires DoD to only use the .mil domain to provide names for IP addresses allocated or assigned to the DoD by the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) and specifically states that these IPs are to be assigned in accordance with the DoD NIC Registry Protocol 9802. DoD Network Information Center (NIC) Registry Protocol 9802 then goes on to state that: “a. ... IP address space is assigned by the DoD NIC83 for use on a DoD common user data network and may not be used to obtain access to the internet via a commercial internet service provider. And b. IP address space will only be used on the common user network to which it is registered. IP address space or subnets of IP address space will not be shared amongst different common user networks. For example, IP address space assigned for SIPRNET use must be used only on the SIPRNET while IP address space assigned for NIPRNET use must be used only on the NIPRNET.” Interpret this to mean that DoD IP addresses are only to be used on DoD systems located on or connected to as an extension of the NIPRNET or SIPRNET. Furthermore, it requires that a .mil URL not redirect to non-.mil domain named hosts (e.g., name.mil will not redirect to name.com) with the only exception being for an approved and accredited service that provides redirection not readily apparent to the end user (e.g., use of a content delivery service or cloud service). This exception permits the use of a Canonical Name (CNAME) in the system’s DNS record within the DoD DNS servers that redirects the URL to the CSP assigned URL associated with the commercial IP address. As such the end user must not be made readily aware of the redirection. Note: The example of electronic mail (email) in DoDI 8410.01 paragraph 3.a and previously in this section does not negate the use of an external commercial cloud email service by DoD components providing the URL to access the service ends in “.mil” and the redirection is not readily apparent to the user. Note: IP addresses assigned by ARIN to the DoD NIC, which are then assigned to DoD components for their networks and information systems, (e.g., NIPRNet addresses) are unique publicly routable addresses. RFC 1918 addresses are “private” (non-publicly routable) which are permitted/used within DoD network enclaves and within CSO enclaves behind the external publicly routable addresses. 		
5.10.4.1								IP Addressing of CSOs and Mission Owner Systems/Applications Off-Premises Impact Level 2 IaaS/PaaS/SaaS: Due to off-premises Impact Level 2 IaaS/PaaS/SaaS CSOs being directly accessed from the internet, DoD Mission Owner systems/applications using the .mil domain that are implemented in an Impact Level 2 IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS CSO where the mission owner has control over their IP addressing will be addressed using public IP addresses assigned and managed by the CSP. This also applies to DoD mission owner systems/applications approved to use non-.mil domain names. In this case the DoD DNS server will use a CNAME for a .mil URL to point to the commercial URL and its IP address. Similarly, PaaS or SaaS CSOs where the mission owner does not have control over the IP addressing will be addressed using public IP addresses assigned and managed by the CSP. Note: The use of “private” RFC 1918 IP addresses internal to the virtual network enclave with commercial addresses on the internet-facing interfaces is acceptable and is recommended minimally for topology hiding. Off-Premises Impact Level 4/5: DoD IP addresses are assigned/managed by the DoD NIC84 and may be further managed and assigned to networks and ISs by DoD component NICs. In accordance with DoD policy NIPRNet, subtended component enclave networks, and their internally connected endpoints are addressed using DoD NIPRNet IP addresses. Note: The following is NOT applicable to DoD systems that are not connected to, or not part of, the NIPRNet and are already approved to use Non-DoD, Non-NIPRNet, IP addresses. There is no intent to force such DoD systems to become part of the NIPRNet. Since, by default, mission owners systems/applications instantiated in IaaS and in some PaaS CSOs have full control over the IP addressing of their systems/applications instantiated in the CSO, and since they are connected to NIPRNet through a NIPRNet BCAP, DoD NIPRNet IP addresses will be used. This also applies to SaaS and PaaS where the mission owner has control over the IP addressing used in their portion of the CSO. As such these systems/applications are within a network enclave that is considered an extension of the NIPRNet. The DoD NIC has set aside a range of NIPRNet IP addresses for CSOs connected to the NIPRNet BCAP. Mission owners/CSO sponsors may make IP address requests through the DoD NIC Website85.This requirement applies similarly to networks other than NIPRNet where a BCAP is required. In such cases IP addresses used on that network will be used. Note: As with any DoD enclave, the use of “private” RFC 1918 IP addresses internal to the virtual network enclave with NIPRNet addresses on the NIPRNet/internet-facing interfaces connected via the BCAP is acceptable. DoD’s objective requirement for all off-premises Level 4/5 CSP’s PaaS and SaaS CSOs serving the DoD where the mission owner does not have control over IP addressing, is for the CSO to offer a “bring your own” IP address capability for all customer facing interfaces so that DoD NIPRNet IP addresses may be used and accessed via the private connection and BCAP. In this case, customer-facing interfaces include general user interfaces and customer management interfaces including CSO customer service management/ordering portals. DoD does not want to be required to access such portals via the internet except during initial setup of the CSO. This IP addressing requirement does not include CSP systems instantiated within the CSO infrastructure that are not customer facing or directly accessible from the NIPRNet (or other mission partner network). Such internal systems and infrastructure may use CSP assigned and managed IP addresses. In the event a mission owner’s application in I/PaaS where they have control of the addressing, or the P/SaaS CSO where the Mission Owner does not have control of the addressing, must face both NIPRNet and internet via the BCAP, separate IP ranges must be assigned to the NIPRNetonly facing servers from those assigned to servers available from NIPRNet and the internet. This is to facilitate registering the internet-facing IP addresses as DoD DMZ addresses and adding them to the DoD DMZ/IAP whitelist while protecting the NIPRNet facing servers from internet threats. Level 4/5 Commercial IP Addressing and Routing for SaaS and Some PaaS: DoD recognizes that with some off-premises commercial SaaS and PaaS CSOs today, it is not possible or practical for the CSO to support customer IP addressing for several reasons. In such cases, the Mission Owner will not have control over the IP addressing of the CSO as would be the case with a “bring your own” IP address capability and therefore, CSP managed commercial IP addresses must be used and interfaced with the NIPRNet via the BCAP. DoD’s preferred solution is for the CSP to provide a NAT or proxy between the CSO and NIPRNet BCAP so that NIPRNet need only route DoD IP addresses. Alternate solutions that require a CSO’s commercial IP addresses to be routed on the NIPRNet must be assessed and approved through a Non-DoD addressing risk assessment and risk acceptance process which may affect the ability of the CSO to be awarded a DoD PA or may result in a PA with conditions. The CSP must work and coordinate with DISA to achieve such an alternate solution to minimize the operational and cybersecurity effects on the DISN/NIPRNet. The following is a set of minimum constraints and requirements that will be considered for the Non-DoD addressing risk acceptance/PA conditions and must be adhered to for ongoing operations: • Vendors shall provide a complete list of their commercial IP subnets that need to be routed on NIPRNet in order to affect such routing. o These route advertisements must be aggregated to /24 or larger blocks in support of current DISN capabilities. Although changes are to be expected over time, the frequency of changes to the list must be minimal to lessen the management burden on DISA Operators, and to reduce network service disruptions. • Commercial IP subnets advertised to NIPRNet via the BCAP used to access DoD services and applications in off-premises CSOs must be dedicated to DoD and separate from the IP addresses used to access the CSO from the internet. • Commercial IP subnets advertised to NIPRNet via the BCAP used to access DoD services and applications in off-premises CSOs must not also be advertised to the internet from the CSP’s infrastructure, or if so, they must not be reachable from the internet (i.e., L4/5 DoD accounts, services, and applications which, per DoD policy, are only to be accessible from the NIPRNet must not be accessible directly from the internet). This means that the same IP addresses must not be used for accessing the CSO from the NIPRNet that are used for accessing it from the internet. This will cause routing issues for both parties. • In the event a mission owner’s application in P/SaaS CSO where the mission owner does not have control of the addressing must face both NIPRNet and internet via the BCAP, separate IP ranges must be assigned to the NIPRNet-only facing servers from those assigned to servers available from NIPRNet and the internet. This is to facilitate registering the internet-facing IP addresses as DoD DMZ addresses and adding them to the DoD DMZ/IAP whitelist while protecting the NIPRNet facing servers from internet threats. • While DoD expects the CSO’s commercial IP addresses used to access L4/5 DoD accounts, services, and applications in the CSO via the BCAP and private connection to be dedicated for DoD NIPRNet user access, in the event the CSO must use the same IP addresses for access by all CSP/CSO customers, whether DoD or non-DoD, (this assumes the non-DoD customers access is via the internet) then the CSP must take extra precautions to prevent the CSO’s internet connection or a compromised system from becoming a back door to the NIPRNet. Furthermore, the CSP must also ensure that direct traffic to the CSO from the internet is not potentially routed over NIPRNet. • DISA will NOT advertise any CSP’s commercial IP subnets used for both direct internet access and NIPRNet to the internet via the NIPRNet IAPs. Doing so could cause unauthorized traffic to the CSO from the internet to attempt to traverse the NIPRNet. DISA cannot support such traffic for both operational and cybersecurity reasons. Only DoD IP addresses associated with .mil URLs or a CSO’s DoD dedicated commercial IP addresses accepted as routable on NIPRNet may be advertised to the internet via the IAPs. • In the event a mission owner implements a “Cloud” VPN between the BCAP and their Intranet gateway/boundary for a CSO that is also used by other mission owners, the same commercial IP addresses may be visible and reachable from the NIPRNet, internet, and Mission owner's intranet. In this case, it is the responsibility of the mission owner to control their own routing policies. The mission owner shall implement routing and security policies within their network to enforce service access control, during both normal and failure scenarios. Off-premises Impact Level 6: All off-premises CSP’s level 6 CSOs will be treated, designed, and addressed as an extension of the SIPRNet (i.e., a SIPRNet network enclave) or other Secret mission partner network. All mission owner systems/applications instantiated in IaaS/PaaS (i.e., VMs and virtual network device interfaces) and connected to SIPRNet will be addressed using SIPRNet IP addresses. This includes management plane systems and interfaces. All off-premises CSP level 6 SaaS and some PaaS service offerings connected to SIPRNet must use DoD assigned and managed SIPRNet IP addresses throughout. Alternate internal addressing will require a waiver. On-premises Impact Level 2/4/5: All on-premises Level 2/4/5 IaaS/PaaS/SaaS CSOs and mission owner systems/applications will be addressed using DoD NIPRNet IP addresses. On-premises Impact Level 6: All on-premises level 6 IaaS/PaaS/SaaS CSOs and mission owner systems/applications will be addressed using DoD SIPRNet IP addresses. 		
5.10.4.2								Domain Name Services (DNS) DoD .mil DNS servers on NIPRNet (and .smil.mil DNS servers on SIPRNet) are authoritative for DoD IP addresses provided through the DoD NIC and subtended Component NICs. This means that the DoD .mil DNS servers resolve .mil URLs to their destination IP address. DoD .mil DNS servers on NIPRNet must also be used to host .mil URLs which cannot have a specific IP address associated with it. In this case, a CNAME is used in the DoD .mil DNS servers on NIPRNet to point to a commercial URL used by the CSO. DoD .mil DNS servers on NIPRNet are protected using various security measures such as the DoD DNS proxies, the Enterprise Recursive service, and DNSSec. As such DoD DNS is protected from many DNS threats and DoD DNS and associated protective services must be used for DoD .mil URLs and address resolution as appropriate. General Rule, All On-Premises and Off-Premises Impact Levels 2/4/5: In general and IAW DoDI 8410.01 mission owner systems/applications using the .mil domain instantiated in an IaaS/PaaS/SaaS CSO where the mission owner has control over the IP addressing and is using DoD NIPRNet IP addresses, must host their .mil DNS records in the DoD .mil NIPRNet authoritative DNS servers, not public or commercial DNS servers. Therefore, such mission owners are not authorized to use DNS services offered by the CSP or any other non-DoD DNS provider unless otherwise approved to use another domain. Note: Mission owners using non-.mil URLs may use CSP managed or other commercial/public DNS servers (not the DoD DNS servers) for the domains in which they are authorized to operate. The following exceptions to the general rule noted above apply: Exception for Off-Premises Impact Level 2: DoD mission owners using an off-Premises impact level 2 CSO which by default uses CSP managed commercial IP addresses and URLs must host their .mil DNS records in the DoD .mil NIPRNet DNS servers and use a CNAME to point to the commercial URL or IP address as appropriate. CSP DNS servers will be authoritative for commercial IP address resolution. Exception for Off-Premises Impact Levels 4/5 SaaS and some PaaS: DoD mission owners using an off-premises impact level 4/5 CSO (IaaS and some PaaS) where the Mission Owner does not have control over the IP addressing and therefore is dependent upon CSP managed commercial IP addresses and URLs must host their .mil DNS records in the DoD .mil NIPRNet DNS servers and use a CNAME to point to the commercial URL for IP address resolution as appropriate. CSP DNS servers will be authoritative for their commercial IP address resolution. In the event their use is required CSP DNS services including URL redirection and dynamic DNS solutions along with implemented DNS protections will be assessed and approved as appropriate for the CSO’s DoD PA. CSP DNS services must be protected using a DNS proxy and must support DNSSec. The DoD PA will also include a risk assessment of the CSP’s DNS management architecture or outsourced services. All On-Premises and Off-Premises Impact Level 6: DoD mission owners using an on-premises or off-premises impact level 6 CSO will use smil.mil URLs whose DNS records will be hosted on the DoD authoritative DNS servers on the SIPRNet (or other SECRET mission partner network). SIPRNet addresses are assigned by the DoD NIC. Corresponding Security Controls: SC-20, SC-21, SC-22	SC-20,SC-21,SC-22	
5.10.5								Mission Owner Requirements Using SaaS and Some PaaS (All Levels) While protecting/securing/defending the P/SaaS architecture where the mission owner does not have control of the environment is the responsibility of the CSP, mission owners contracting for and using CSP’s P/SaaS offerings must minimally address the following to meet DoD policy: • Register the protocols and services along with their related UDP/TCP IP Ports used by the SaaS service that will traverse the DISN in the DoD PPSM registry. This includes all user and management plane traffic for levels 4, 5, and 6 as well as management plane traffic for level 2 if managed/monitored from within a DoD network. Refer to Section 5.15, Ports, Protocols, Services, Management and Cloud for additional information. • Register the service/application with the DoD DMZ Whitelist for both inbound and outbound traffic if traffic will cross the IAPs. Refer to Section 5.17.2 DoD DMZ Whitelist for more information. Register the Cloud IT Project (CITP) and CSP’s CSO in the DISA SNAP database for the connection approval which also includes the designation of a certified CSSP for the performance of mission cyberspace defense (MCD) actions as defined in Section 6, Cyberspace Defense and Incident Response. This step is required at all levels for SaaS, including Level 2 (even though there is no production connection to the DISN) so that the DoD CSSP community is aware and informed of the CITP such that they can perform their cyberspace defense duties described in . Section 6, Cyberspace Defense and Incident Response. As discussed in Section 5.10.3, CSP Service Architecture, the mission owner is reliant on the security posture of the CSP and their PaaS/SaaS offering for the protection of DoD data/information.		
5.10.6								Mission Owner System/Application Requirements Using IaaS/PaaS This section provides mission owners with an overview of the items they need to address when using an I/PaaS CSO where they have control of over the environment. This is partly to alleviate the perception that putting an application in the cloud takes care of all security responsibilities. The items here reflect general DoD policy. Mission owners must address defense-in-depth security/protective measures across all information impact levels when implementing systems/applications on IaaS/PaaS which include, but are not limited to, the following: • Implement virtual machines (VMs) in one or more virtual networks in which data-flows between VMs and between VMs and external networks (both physical and virtual) may be controlled. Note: Virtual networks are typically a feature of the virtualization hypervisor which supports the VMs. • Implement virtual network(s) in accordance with the approved architecture for the type of application as defined in the Application Security and Development STIG, along with other operating system and application specific STIGs. For example, a web service or application is typically required to have a tiered architecture with unrestricted/restricted/private DMZ zones with appropriate protections for internet/NIPRNet-facing servers and private/“back end” zones with appropriate protections for application/database servers and other supporting systems/servers. • In the event the mission system/application is internet-facing, implement DMZ protections in addition to a zoned architecture described above . For example, this may include the following (adapted for cloud): o Web server in a public virtual network zone (unrestricted or restricted) o Application and database servers in one or more private virtual network zones o Two Routers (virtual for cloud):  Outer – public zone to internet  Inner – public zone to private zone o Reverse Web Proxy (RWP) o FTP proxy if FTP is used o Web Application Firewall (WAF) o Security Information Manager (SIM) o Syslog server o Two Active directory servers  Public zone  Private zone Impact Level 2: DMZ boundary protection requirements (i.e., proxies and firewalls) must be implemented by the mission owner for their application(s) or leverage a common boundary service provided by a larger entity like DoD Component or the DoD enterprise. This will most likely occur on a CSP by CSP basis. Other common services may also be available. Impact level 4: DMZ boundary protection requirements (i.e., proxies, firewalls, etc.) will be provided by the mission owner in their system/application environment until such time as these protections are provided by the mission owner’s agency or DISA as an enterprise service. • When infrastructure has direct internet access, implement virtual application level firewall, and virtual intrusion detection and/or prevention capabilities IAW the applicable DoD SRGs and STIGs to protect the virtual network(s) and interconnected VMs. The mission owner and/or their CSSP must be able to control firewall rules and monitor the virtual network boundary, reporting same to the Tier 1. For dedicated infrastructure with a DISN connection (Levels 4 and 5): implement firewall, IPS, and/or routing methods that restrict traffic flow inbound and outbound to/from the virtual network to the DISN connection IAW DoDI 8551. Block all traffic from all other sources such as the CSP’s network which is most likely connected to the internet. • Implement a secure (encrypted) connection or path (i.e., encrypted VPN) between the virtual firewall, the virtual IDS capabilities, and the CSSP responsible for the mission system/application. Refer to Section 6, Cyberspace Defense and Incident Response for more specific information. • IaaS: Securely configure (harden/STIG)/patch/maintain each VM’s OS and IAW DoD policy and U.S. Cyber Command direction (USCYBERCOM). The use of DoD STIGs and SRGs is required for secure configuration as is compliance with IAVMs. • PaaS: For those VM OSs and applications under direct management of the mission owner (not the CSP per contract), securely configure (harden /STIG)/patch/maintain each VM’s OS and application provided by the CSP IAW DoD policy and USCYBERCOM direction. The use of DoD STIGs and SRGs is required for secure configuration as is compliance with IAVMs. • IaaS/PaaS: Securely configure (harden/STIG)/patch/maintain each application provided/installed by the mission owner IAW DoD policy and USCYBERCOM direction. The use of DoD STIGs and SRGs is required for secure configuration as is compliance with IAVMs. • IaaS/PaaS: Configure virtual networks such that CSO API calls remain on the CSP’s network, not having to traverse the CAP/NIPRNet and internet. This may require a second gateway from the virtual network to the CSP’s network that is restricted to the IP addresses of the API servers. • Implement data-at-rest encryption on all DoD files housed in CSP IaaS storage service offerings. A CSP may offer one or more services or methods to accomplish this. Data-atrest encryption may help mitigate issues with data/information spillage. Refer to Section 5.11, Encryption of Data-at-Rest for more information • If the DoD information is sensitive government information (e.g., FOUO or CUI), FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 validated software cryptography modules operated in FIPS mode must be used. • All encryption services for data-at-rest must be implemented such that the Mission Owner has sole control over key management and use. • Implement Host Based Security System (HBSS) IAW DoD policy. o Implement HBSS agents on all VMs with a supported general purpose OS. o Use an HBSS agent control server (EPO) within NIPRNet or an associated common virtual services environment in the same CSO (e.g., VDMS). o Implement a secure (encrypted) connection or path between the HBSS agents and their control server. o Provide visibility by the Mission Owner’s CSSP entities as defined in Section 6, Cyberspace Defense and Incident Response. • Implement scanning using an Assured Compliance Assessment Solution (ACAS) server IAW USCYBERCOM TASKORD 13-670. o Use an ACAS Security Center server within NIPRNet or within an associated common virtual services environment in the same CSO (e.g., VDMS).  Implement a secure (encrypted) connection or path between the ACAS server and its assigned ACAS Security Center. • Provide visibility by the mission owner’s CSSP entities as defined in Section 6, Cyberspace Defense and Incident Response. o Implement DoD PKI server certificates for establishing secure connections. • Implement all required data-in-transit encryption protections using FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 validated cryptography modules operated in FIPS mode. • Implement DoD CAC/PKI authentication as follows: o For all privileged user access to VM operating systems and applications for Levels 2, 4, and 5 IAW DoD policy. Level 6 must use the CNSS SIPRNet Token. o For all general DoD users of the implemented systems/applications for Levels 4 and 5 IAW DoD policy. Level 6 must use the CNSS SIPRNet Token. o Implement a secure (encrypted) connection or path (i.e., encrypted VPN) between the implemented systems/applications and the DoD OCSP responders on NIPRNet or SIPRNet as applicable • Secure Active Directory (AD) (if used) and any associated trusts IAW the DoD Windows OS STIGs and/or other applicable DoD STIGs. This includes trusts between DoD AD forests and CSP CSO AD forests. If such trusts are required, the implementation must be approved by the AO responsible for the DoD AD forest. Refer to Section 5.10.7, Active Directory Integration for Cloud for more information. • Register the Protocols and Services along with their related UDP/TCP IP Ports used by the Mission Owner’s system/service/application that will traverse the DISN. This includes all traffic for Levels 4, 5, and 6 as well as management/monitoring plane traffic for Level 2. Refer to Section 5.15, Ports, Protocols, Services, Management, and Cloud for additional information. • Register the Mission Owner’s system/service/application with the DoD whitelist for both inbound and outbound traffic if traffic will cross the IAPs. Refer to Section 5.17.2 DoD DMZ Whitelist for more information. • Register the Mission Owner’s system/service/application and CSP’s CSO in the DISA SNAP database for the connection approval which also includes designating a certified CSSP to perform MCD Actions. This step is required at all levels for IaaS/PaaS, including Level 2 (even though there is no production connection to the DISN) so that the DoD CSSP community is aware and informed such that they can perform their Cyberspace Defense duties described in Section 6, Cyberspace Defense and Incident Response. • Implement Cyberspace Defense and Incident Response for monitoring issues across all CSPs used by DoD. Note: Under PaaS (and potentially IaaS) where CSPs may be under contract to securely configure (harden/STIG)/patch/maintain mission owner’s VMs, OSs, applications, or maintain STIGed and patched VM images for their use, such services must be validated to DoD standards IAW all applicable policies (e.g., privileged access). If the CSP is contracted by the mission owner to securely configure OSs and applications, then the CSP is expected to comply with all applicable DoD STIGs. For IAVA compliance, the CSP will be expected to comply with industry best practice by applying patches identified in the CVE that would be referenced in the DoD IAVA. Equivalencies will be assessed and approved on a case-by-case basis. Active Directory Integration for Cloud Active Directory (AD) implementations (if needed) will be configured IAW the Active Directory Domain and Forest STIGs86 along with the following guidance related to Cloud services: • DoD/Commercial CSP CSO on premises private/community (e.g., milCloud) managed AD: o AD servers and forests may establish trust relationships with other DoD managed AD servers and forests IAW established DoD guidelines. • DoD mission owner managed AD instantiated in DoD/Commercial CSP CSO on premises private/community IaaS/PaaS (e.g., milCloud): o AD servers and forests may establish trust relationships with other DoD managed AD servers and forests IAW established DoD guidelines. • DoD mission owner managed AD instantiated in commercial off-premises IaaS/PaaS: o DoD AD forests will not trust mission owner managed AD servers or forests instantiated in commercial IaaS/PaaS. o AD servers and forests may trust other DoD managed AD servers and forests IAW established DoD guidelines. This trust must be one way. Alternate methods than a direct trust such as those described in the following subsections should be used. Note: This mitigates the potential for a compromised mission owner’s AD in the commercial CSO being able to compromise a DoD AD on the DISN • Non-DoD CSP CSO managed AD: o A Non-DoD CSP’s AD may be used to provide access control services to the CSO if it is an integral part of the CSO. (e.g., for SaaS) o DoD AD forests will not trust a Non-DoD CSP’s AD servers or forest. o Only if absolutely required, a Non-DoD CSP’s AD forest may trust a DoD AD forest. This trust must be one way. Alternate methods than a direct trust such as those described in the following subsections should be used. Note: This mitigates the potential for a compromised CSP’s AD being able to compromise a DoD AD on the DISN. Note: Established DoD guidelines for AD implementation are found in the AD Domain and Forrest STIGs noted above.		
5.10.6.1								Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) is used to extend on-premises active directory access control credential use and single sign-on (SSO) capabilities to web servers located in another organization such as a CSP’s SaaS CSO. This capability will enable access control to multiple web applications over the life of a single browser session. This is also applicable to providing SSO capabilities to a Mission Owner’s own web application instantiated in IaaS/PaaS CSO without placing an AD server in the virtual environment. Since ADFS in essence allows the CSP’s CSO or external web application to trust the DoD identity claim asserted on behalf of the DoD AD, the use of ADFS meets the intent of the AD requirements stated above.		
5.10.6.2								Active Directory DirSync (Directory Synchronization) Active Directory DirSync is a Microsoft Azure tool which is specific to a specific Microsoft SaaS CSO. DirSync is installed on a domain-joined server (on-premises or on a Microsoft Azure VM) to “synchronize your on-premises active directory users to Office 365 for professionals and small businesses”87. Since this tool provides user information to the Office 365 AD as a push, then the Office 365 AD is used to provide access control to the CSO for those users, this tool meets the intent of the Non-DoD CSP managed AD requirements stated above.		
5.10.7								Hybrid Cloud-Interconnections Between CSOs There are several reasons why various IL4/5 or IL6 CSOs need to be interconnected. The following sections will address some of the security and architectural constraints surrounding each. Note: In the event of the interconnection of a higher impact level CSO with a lower impact level CSO, the transfer of the higher impact information to the lower impact level CSO must be prevented unless an approved cross domain solution (CDS) is used and appropriate approval procedures are followed. 		
5.10.7.1								Mission Owners Applications Mission owner’s applications or cloud use cases might need to leverage multiple off-premises CSOs for various reasons. For IL4/5 or IL6 CSOs, the interconnection of these CSOs must be monitored such that unauthorized traffic and information transfer is avoided and audited. • Connections between CSOs from the same CSP will remain on the CSP’s network. • Connections between CSOs from different CSPs will traverse the CSO’s connections to the meet-me router(s). While not desirable due to circuit capacity usage concerns, some traffic might be routed through the BCAP if deemed necessary. In all cases, auditing of traffic will be performed by the interconnected CSOs. Some auditing may occur at the meet-me router (or BCAP) for those connections that traverse these points. 		
5.10.7.2								On/Off-Premises Scenarios Mission owner’s applications or cloud use cases might need to leverage multiple IL4/5 or IL6 CSOs that are both on-premises and off-premises. The interconnection of these CSOs will be via the BCAP.		
5.10.7.3								SaaS CSOs Using “External Services” A commercial CSP, to provide a complete SaaS CSO, may leverage one or more third-party “external services”. These may include notification services or scanning and audit services, and/or others. CSOs seeking an IL4/5 PA must ensure that sensitive DoD data is not transmitted to, or via, such external services unless that service has a DoD PA or is addressed in the CSO’s PA. If the CSO is an IL4/5 CSO, traffic to and from such services will not traverse the DISN BCAP assuming the CSO serves non-DoD customers. The CSP must ensure that such external service connections, likely to be via the internet, do not permit access to NIPRNet via the BCAP from such connections. 		
5.11								Encryption of Data-at-Rest in Commercial Cloud Storage Mission systems at all impact levels must have the capability for DoD data to be encrypted at rest with exclusive DoD control of encryption keys and key management. Some CSOs may facilitate this by providing a hardware security module (HSM) or offering customer dedicated HSM devices as a service. CSOs that do not provide such a capability may require mission owners to use encryption hardware/software on the DISN or a cloud encryption service that provides DoD control of keys and key management. Some CSOs may offer a KMS service that can suffice for management of customer keys by the customer while preventing CSP access to the keys. It is recommended that such CSP KMS services be evaluated by NSA. Data-at-rest (DAR) encryption with customer controlled keys and key management protects the DoD data stored in CSOs with the following benefits: • Maintains the integrity of publicly released information and websites at Level 2 where confidentiality is not an issue. • Maintains the confidentiality and integrity of CUI at levels 4 and 5 with the following benefits: o Limits the insider threat vector of unauthorized access by CSP personnel through increasing the work necessary to compromise/access unencrypted DoD data. o Limits the external threat vector of unauthorized access by hackers through increasing the work necessary to compromise/access unencrypted DoD data. o Enables high-assurance data destruction for CSP off-boarding through cryptographic erasure and file deletion without the involvement or cooperation of a CSP. o Enables high-assurance data spill remediation through cryptographic erasure and file deletion without the involvement or cooperation of a CSP. o Refer to Section 5.11.1, Cryptographic Erase for additional information. Note: Mission owners and their AOs should consider the benefits of DAR encryption for data destruction and/or spill remediation at Level 2 in addition to the benefit of maintaining integrity of the information. For all Information Impact levels: • Encrypt all Data at Rest (DAR): o Stored in virtual machine virtual hard drives or o Stored in mass storage facilities/services whether at the block or file level o Stored in database records (whether PaaS, SaaS where the MO does not have sole control over the DB and DBMS) • Using FIPS 140-2 or FIPS 140-3 validated cryptography modules88 (minimally Level 1) operated in FIPS Mode in accordance with federal government policy/standards for the protection of all CUI. o Cryptography modules include cryptographic algorithm, RNG, KMI, HASH, etc. (all approved functions) • CSP Customer/Mission Owner (MO) maintains control of the keys, from creation through storage and use to destruction o Implement hardware security modules (HSM) or key management servers as needed to store, generate, and manage keys within the DISN o OR Order a CSP service that provides a dedicated HSM that is managed solely by the customer/MO o OR Order a CSP KMS service that has been evaluated by NSA. For cloud applications where encrypting DAR with DoD key control is not possible, mission owners must perform a risk analysis with relevant data owners before transferring data into a CSO. This analysis must take into account that there may be no high-assurance method available to remediate data spills or ensure destruction of data at the application’s end of life and CSO offboarding. Mission owner AOs are responsible for accepting these risks. Note: CSPs CSOs DAR encryption capabilities and ability to support mission owner’s DAR encryption requirements will be assessed and documented toward the award of their DoD PA. Corresponding Security Controls: SC-28, SC-28(1)	SC-28,SC-28 (1)	
5.11.1								Cryptographic erase is described in NIST SP 800-88 Rev 189: “Cryptographic Erase is an emerging sanitization technique that can be used in some situations when data is encrypted as it is stored on media. With CE, media sanitization is performed by sanitizing the cryptographic keys used to encrypt the data, as opposed to sanitizing the storage locations on media containing the encrypted data itself. CE techniques are typically capable of sanitizing media very quickly and could support partial sanitization, a technique where a subset of storage media is sanitization. Partial sanitization, sometimes referred to as selective sanitization, has potential applications in cloud computing.” While much of the CE guidance in SP 800-88 is related to self-encrypting devices, this section expands on NIST’s acknowledgement that CE has applicability in cloud computing. DAR encryption, coupled with exclusive customer control of cryptographic key management, provides DoD the ability to cryptographically erase data at rest without CSP assistance or cooperation. This capability coupled with standard CSP provided data deletion provides the following benefits described for DAR encryption in Section 5.11 above. Data deletion refers to normal file or data record deletion methods used in file systems and databases. Deletion before or after cryptographic erase will restore resources to the CSP and will permit for the eventual overwriting of the data under normal operations. To support cryptographic erase and the various benefits it provides DAR encryption must be performed at an appropriate level of granularity. This means that one key should not be used to encrypt all or large chunks of mission owner data. Related Security Controls: MP-6(3), MP-6(8)	MP-6 (3),MP-6 (8)	
5.12								Backup CSPs are responsible for providing backups of data in a CSO consistent with the CP-9 security control. Mission owners are also responsible for assuring their data is backed up consistent with the CP-9. However, mission owners must also consider the risk of entrusting their data to a single non-DoD CSP. Section 5.8, Data Retrieval and Destruction for Off-boarding from a CSO discusses the importance of mission owners being ready to recover and/or migrate their data on short notice in case of CSO shutdown. This readiness, along with CSP backup requirements, may be sufficient for DoD data of low to moderate impact value. However, mission owners with higher impact value data should consider conducting regular backups of their data and storing them in DoD-owned infrastructure/media or a cloud storage service offered by a different CSP. Backups stored with a different provider reduce the risk of data loss/corruption in the case of a CSO ceasing operations or catastrophic event that affects a CSP’s entire infrastructure. Maintenance of such backups may also mitigate the risk of data loss sustained from of a data spillage response. Mission owners should determine the potential need for such risk mitigation as part of the contingency planning required by the CP-2 security control. Note: In the case of IaaS/PaaS backups, “data” as used in this section includes VM snapshots or images of the fully configured VMs including their virtual hard drives so that restoration of the computational base is as easy as the restoration of the information processed. Note: This section is provided for consideration by mission owners. It does not affect CSPs or DoD PA assessments. Corresponding Security Controls: CP-2, CP-9	CP-2,CP-9	
5.13								DoD Contractor/DoD Component Mission Partner Use of CSOs This section focuses specifically on Non-CSP DoD contractors or mission partners (e.g., defense industrial base (DIB) contractors) and DoD Component mission partners (e.g., commissaries, exchanges, educational entities) whose networks that are not part of the DODIN .mil domain. These mission partners and their networks are typically in the .gov, .org, .com, .edu domains. When using cloud services, mission partners and contractors are responsible for following all guidance in this CC SRG related to the mission owner that is not specific to a DISN-provided capability (e.g., CAP) or an enterprise service. The appropriate impact level must be selected based on the DoD data being processed. A trusted means of communication that encrypts all DoD data transferred between mission partners and contractor internal networks and CSPs must be used. Mission partners and contractors are also responsible for working with the appropriate DoD data owner or designated agency (e.g., DSS) to create incident response procedures for incidents that occur in a CSO. Note: The term “Non-CSP DoD Contractors” as used below does not include DoD Contractors that are not a CSP but aggregate CSOs (i.e., integrators) in the fulfillment of a contract for cloud services. As such, and as noted elsewhere in this CC SRG, the CSOs these non-CSP integrators are providing via subcontracts must follow all guidance related to CSOs and DoD’s usage of them. 		
5.13.1								DoD Component Mission Partners DoD Component mission partners in the .gov, .org, .com, .edu domains must only use CSPs or CSOs that have a DoD PA for the information impact level that best matches the CNSSI 1253 categorization of the information to be processed/stored/transmitted by the CSP/CSO. If the information is public, then a level 2 CSO will be used with direct internet access. Otherwise, accessing level 4/5 services depends on how their organizational network/enclave is connected today. This may be as follows:  The organizational network/enclave: • Is part of NIPRNet; connectivity to the CSO will be via the NIPRNet BCAP • Is part of a mission partner or COI network with a BCAP; connectivity to the CSO will be via that BCAP • Is directly connected to the internet via one or more approved organizational IAPs; connectivity to the CSO will be via the internet or a private direct connection. Such connections will be appropriately secured for the protection of the organization’s network and information/applications in the cloud. The organization's network boundary with the CSP's network will be considered a BCAP and will provide boundary protections and monitoring as required for the protection of the specific organization's network and information it contains. DoD Component mission partners are responsible for implementing appropriate boundary protections for their networks. 		
5.13.2								Non-CSP DoD Contractors and DIB Partners Use of CSOs for the Protection of Sensitive DoD Information Non-CSP DoD contractors and DIB partners may store, process, and use or create sensitive DoD data/information outside of the DODIN in conjunction with a DoD contract not associated with providing cloud services. Such contractors are required to protect unclassified sensitive DoD data/information while it is in their environment (i.e., contractor owned/operated IT systems used by the contractor to support contractor functions that store DoD CUI) IAW DoDI 8582.01, Security of Unclassified DoD Information on Non-DoD Information Systems90 and NIST SP 800- 171, Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Information Systems and Organizations91which primarily focuses on confidentiality. Non-CSP DoD contractors and DIB partners may wish to use cloud services in the fulfillment of their contract or for the protection/processing of DoD data they possess (i.e., CUI or Covered Defense Information (CDI)). Thus, for the protection of sensitive CUI/CDI, it is highly recommended that Non-CSP DoD contractors use CSOs that have been granted a DoD Level 4 PA. Such CSOs must not be dedicated to DoD which would mean the CSO is only connected to the NIPRNet. That said, access to the CSP/CSO will be via the internet or a private direct connection. The NIPRNet will not be used as a connection path. DoD contractors are responsible for implementing appropriate boundary protections for their networks and the protection of information placed in the cloud. Non-CSP DoD contractors and DIB partners may NOT use CSOs that have been granted a DoD Level 5 PA as such contractors are outside the supported community of Federal agencies until such time as DoD changes this level 5 limitation. Note: Non-CSP DoD Contractors and DIB Partners are required to comply with NIST SP 800- 171 for the protection of CUI/CDI. The DoD level 4 and level 5 baselines cover all of the C/CE referenced in the SP 800-171 except CM-3(2), CM-7(4), and IR-2(1). 		
5.13.3								Non-CSP DoD Contractors Use of CSOs as a Portion of a Non-CSO Product or Service A non-CSP DoD contractor might choose to integrate a third-party CSO as a component of a contracted Non-CSO product or service (e.g., a weapons system or major application). Such contractors may only use third-party CSPs or CSOs that have a DoD PA for the information impact level that best matches the CNSSI 1253 categorization of the information to be processed/stored/transmitted by the CSP/CSO. Furthermore, the CSO and its use must follow the CC SRG guidance related to the Mission Owner that is not specific to a DISN-provided capability (e.g., CAP) or an enterprise service to the greatest extent possible. Connectivity to the CSO will be determined by where the contracted product or service will be used and related guidance in this CC SRG. For example, if the user base for the product or service is NIPRNet based and the Information Impact Level is 4 or 5, then the NIPRNet BCAP must be used. If the Information Impact Level is 2, then the internet may be used. All CC SRG requirements apply to the product and flow down to the sub-contracted CSO IAW various DFARS clauses. In the event the Non-CSP DoD contractor chooses to provide/host the CSO themselves, the CC SRG requirements for the Information Impact Level that best matches the CNSSI 1253 categorization of the information to be processed/stored/transmitted by the CSO applies. If the CSO is dedicated to the product, A&A will handled IAW normal DoD contract A&A requirements. Consideration for awarding a DoD PA in this case will depend on the results of the A&A processes, compliance with the CC SRG, and the potential for other DoD Component’s mission owners to use the CSO. 		
5.14								DoD Mission Owner Test and Development in the Cloud Cloud environments are a good place for mission owners to do application development and testing as well as research testing. Furthermore, test and development activities associated with application lifecycle management for cloud-based applications are best performed in the same cloud environment as the production application. This section addresses DoD test and development (T&D) activities in IaaS and PaaS CSOs where the mission owner has control of the environment. Note: This section does not directly apply to third-party DoD contractor companies developing applications for DoD in I/PaaS CSOs. Unless stated otherwise in the contract, the contractor may perform their contract activities in whatever environment they choose, in the cloud or not. Therefore, the contractor is responsible for the security of their T&D environment and the security (i.e., CIS) of the code being developed. However, the contractor must follow industry best practice and/or follow the guidance provided here. Security requirements for DoD T&D and laboratory environments are defined in the suite of Enclave T&D STIGs92. Refer to these STIGs on Cyber Exchange for the latest guidance. This section of the CC SRG does not change the security requirements associated for each zone but it adds nuance when operating in the cloud. All T&D Zones instantiated in the cloud must comply with these STIGs except for the nuanced remote access guidance added here. The Enclave T&D STIG overview document defines four (4) T&D Zones. These zones are briefly described as follows: • Zone A: Instrumental in application lifecycle management for final end stage testing prior to implementation into a production environment. This environment is connected to the production network to replicate the final production environment supporting the application. The use of VPNs for remote access for developers and administrators may be implemented, but must be terminated in the T&D DMZ for inspection. The assets in the environment are secured the same as the production environment to include STIG and IAVM compliance. Minimal development is permitted for final revisions and minor updates in the final testing phase. Note: Zone A supports or is representative of the environments in which the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) and Joint Interoperability Test Command (JITC) performs DoD’s Test and Evaluation (T&E) on DoD applications and systems. • Zone B: Instrumental in application lifecycle management for application development activities such as coding, compliance, and testing. This environment provides connectivity to the production network with access controls in place to protect the production network for application testing. Provides an isolated network segment for the use of tools and capabilities to facilitate application development that would not be permitted in the production environment. Implements remote access to the testing segment of the environment for developers and administrators. Is secured WRT STIG and IAVA compliance at the discretion of the IAM. • Zone C: Closed test environment not connected to DoD production networks but interconnects multiple testing environments through the use of direct connections or tunneling mechanisms. This environment can be used for testing systems, devices, applications, tools, and/or protocols where their security posture or potential to threaten DoD production networks is unknown or known to be risky while needing long-haul network connectivity. • Zone D: A fully closed and physically separate network from any DoD live operational network for the purpose of extensive testing using prohibited tools, working with malicious code, virus samples, working with Ports, Protocols, and Services (PPS) that are otherwise restricted via DoD policy. Development within this environment is generally not an encouraged practice. All DoD test and development performed in cloud infrastructure must be categorized IAW the T&D Zone descriptions in the Enclave T&D STIG Overview document and comply with the security requirements in the associated Enclave T&D STIG. Since Zones A and B are instrumental in application lifecycle management and able to be connected to the production network, it is reasonable that these zones can and should be implemented in the same IaaS/PaaS cloud infrastructure as the production applications they support. Due to the robust routing and filtering capabilities inherent in today’s virtual networks, the segmentation of these zones can easily be implemented IAW the related Zone A and B STIG requirements using VLANs or distinct virtual networks. Application lifecycle management typically involves an application development Zone B, an application test Zone A, and a production zone. Each zone has its own cyber security requirements that must be implemented to protect the zone itself and the DODIN. As with DoD production applications, T&D zones A and B may be instantiated in DoD private I/PaaS CSOs connected to the NIPRNet. T&D zones A and B must also be protected and monitored by the same CSSP as the production zone when implemented in the same CSO. DoD application test Zone A instantiated in cloud infrastructure must be implemented in the same CSP/CSO with the same information impact level and having the same connectivity model as the production application zone to support lifecycle management of the application. The sensitivity of the information processed by the production application determines the information impact level of the CSO and its PA IAW this SRG. While there may be some exceptions based on where the application developers reside, this also applies to DoD application development Zone B when used for the lifecycle management of a production application. Placing all three zones in the same CSO using the same connectivity model and CSSP as the production application zone helps to realize the efficiencies of the cloud and ultimately better protect the application, the information being processed/stored and the DODIN DoD application development Zone B instantiated in cloud infrastructure must minimally be implemented in a CSP’s CSO that has a Level 2 PA to support pre-production application development with developers accessing the zone via the internet. Consideration for implementing Zone B in a Level 4/5 CSO for this purpose, will depend on the sensitivity of the application itself and its code. This is at the discretion of the program’s IAM or responsible AO. Again, once pre-production development is complete and if the Zone B is to be used for the lifecycle management of a production application, then it should be implemented in the same CSP/CSO as the production application. While the systems within the Zone B are not required to be STIG compliant and may not be subject to the same HBSS and ACAS requirements as a Zone A or the production zone, the network infrastructure and network transport must be STIG compliant. This includes a properly hardened zone boundary stack to protect the less than secure inside of the zone. This boundary must be monitored and protected by a CSSP. While Zones C and D are typically implemented in physical facilities and while various aspects may use virtualization, these zones may only be implemented in cloud services providing the required lack of connectivity to DoD production networks. This generally precludes on-premises CSOs connected to NIPRNet which are intended for wide usage by multiple DoD tenants such as milCloud as designed today. Alternately Zones C and/or D might be implemented in an offpremises commercial or an on-premises DoD cloud environment where there is no direct connectivity to DoD networks, providing the testing activities do not threaten the CSP’s CSO and/or network, other CSP tenants’ systems/applications or the internet. Additional exceptions and requirements for these use cases may be provided in a future release of this or another SRG. Zones C and D which might be categorized at Levels 4/5/6 and implemented in off-premises CSOs are not permitted to connect to the DISN; i.e., these zones will not connect via a BCAP. Zones C and D may or may not be monitored and protected by a CSSP, however a CSSP must be aligned to receive incident reports and perform incident response. Corresponding Security Controls: CM-4, CM-4 (1)	CM-4, CM-4 (1)	
5.14.1								Workstation Connectivity to Cloud Based T&D Zones Workstation connectivity to all T&D zones instantiated in the cloud will use remote connectivity methods as a result of the nature of Cloud. The different zones require different types of workstations and remote connectivity models. The options are as follows: • Application test zone A is accessed in the same manner as the production application. o Workstations are NIPRNet connected. As with the production application, STIGed government furnished equipment (GFE) must be used to manage the environment and test the application. • Application development Zone B connectivity: o Zone B is in the same CSO as the associated Zone A and production zone (commercial off-premises or DoD private on-premises) supporting lifecycle management of the production application:  If the development workstations are NIPRNet connected, as with the production application, STIGed government furnished equipment (GFE) must be used to manage the environment and test the application. A remote terminal solution may be used (e.g., Citrix, Terminal Services (bastion host)). A VPN is only required for tunneling sensitive data. o Zone B is in a separate CSO from the associated Zone A and production zone supporting pre-production application development:  Commercial off-premises CSO with off-premises contracted developers: NonGFE may be used across the internet using a VPN or encrypted protocols.  Commercial off-premises CSO with on-premises DoD or contracted developers: Zone B must be configured behind its own firewall. A VPN must be used to access the Zone. STIGed GFE must be used due to NIPRNet connectivity. A remote terminal solution is also required after the VPN has been established into the Zone B environment (e.g., Citrix, Terminal Services (bastion host)) where the local WS cannot be compromised from the windowed view of the systems in the zone. The path may be via the IAPs/internet or BCAP/private connection • T&D/Research Zones C and D:  o Typically, workstations accessing a zone D must do so from within the zone, or from the coupled zone D in a Zone C construct. Cloud presents several different scenarios as follows:  Zone D or all portions of a Zone C are instantiated in an internet-connected CSO: workstations connect via the internet. NIPRNet connectivity is generally precluded except for dedicated hardware connecting via a dedicated network or segmented NIPRNet path using VLANs, VRFs, and/or VPNs.  One or more Zone D enclaves of a Zone C construct are physical zone D enclaves on DoD premises: All portions of the Zone C including those portions implemented in an off-premises CSO must be accessed from workstations within the Zone C (i.e., the physical zone D enclaves). In this scenario there should be no need for remote access from outside the Zone D or C.		
5.15								Ports, Protocols, Services, Management and Cloud Based Systems/Applications Mission owners using CSOs of any service type (I/P/SaaS) must comply with DoDI 8551.01: Ports, Protocols, and Services Management (PPSM)93 when implementing and operating their systems/applications in an IaaS/PaaS CSO or when using a SaaS offering. DoDI 8551.01 is the DoD policy that provides policy guidance for DoD mission owner compliance with CM-7, CM-7 (1), and SA-9 (2). While CSPs must comply with these C/CE for their internal networks and service offerings, DoDI 8551.01 does not apply to CSPs as the policy applies to Protocols and Services (PS) traversing the DISN. The DISA PPSM office94 95, along with the PPSM Change Control Board (CCB) and Technical Advisory Group (TAG) publish a Category Assignment List (CAL) which lists the PS permitted to cross certain DISN boundaries and vulnerability assessments (VAs) for each PS listed. Compliance with VAs is the key to the secure usage of the PS listed in the CAL. In other words, PS used on the DISN must comply with the associated VA. Mission owners must use the mitigations presented in the PPS VAs when building their systems. Additionally, all mission owners must register their cloud CSO based systems/applications in the DoD PPSM Registry (only available on SIPRNet) to include systems/applications in an I/PaaS CSO or when using a SaaS offering. Registration includes all PS along with their related UDP/TCP IP Ports used by the application that will traverse the DISN. This includes all user and management plane traffic for levels 4, 5, and 6 as well as management plane traffic for Level 2 if managed/monitored from within a DoD network. While the use of non-standard ports for application and/or system to system connectivity, which may be an effective means of mitigating application-specific vulnerabilities, any such usage must be reflected on a DoD PPSM vulnerability assessment (VA) and on the CAL. Such use cases that cross DISN boundaries must be submitted by the Mission Owner to the PPSM CCB/TAG for assessment and approval. The remainder of this section of the CC SRG provides guidance to mission owners when registering their applications in the PPSM database. Level 2 Off-premises CSO: A Level 2 mission owner virtual network, virtual machines, and applications in IaaS/PaaS CSOs constitute a DoD enclave within and accessed via an external network. Similarly, a SaaS CSO is an enclave within and accessed via an external network. This external network is the internet. For level 2, the mission owner should leverage PPSM guidance for PPSM boundaries 1-5. This is only applicable to mission owner’s management traffic for their virtual networks and systems/applications in IaaS/PaaS and CSO management traffic for I/P/SaaS. When registering the application in the PPSM database the mission owner should register on boundaries 1-5. Since non-privileged user traffic will be via the internet, registration is not required even if a portion of this traffic is to/from non-privileged users within the DODIN. Such traffic will traverse the DISN IAPs as any other web-based traffic. Note: This guidance may change with regard to user plane traffic pending a decision of the PPSM CCB. Since firewalls and sensors are required at the boundary of a mission owner’s virtual enclave and since the sensors will be monitored by the MCD protecting the mission owner’s system/application, the same or similar guidance as is provided for Level 4/5/6 below may be applicable. Level 2/4/5/6 On-premises CSO: On-premises CSOs at any level will be treated as normal DoD enclaves. PPSM Registrations will use boundary designations 7-11 if directly connected or 10-12 and 15 if connected via an IPsec tunnel. Levels 4/5/6 Off-premises CSO: IAW the CC SRG, Levels 4/5/6 Off-premises CSOs will be treated as normal DoD enclaves since they are architected as extensions of the DODIN/DISN even though the CSO is in an external network (the CSP’s network) and are connected via a BCAP. As such, PPSM Registrations will use boundary designations 7-11 if directly connected or 10-12 and 15 if connected via an IPsec tunnel. Note: PS designated as local services may be used within the mission owner’s system/application virtual enclave in IaaS/PaaS CSOs as with any other enclave providing they do not traverse the virtual enclave’s boundary. 		
5.16								Mobile Code Mobile code is defined as software programs or parts of programs obtained from remote information systems, transmitted across a network, and executed on a local information system without explicit installation or execution by the recipient. Some examples of software technologies that provide the mechanisms for the production and use of mobile code include Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, VBScript, etc. Mobile Code presents a great number of attack vectors to both CSPs and DoD mission owners. CSP organizational IT systems as well as the infrastructure that supports CSOs are vulnerable to malicious mobile code, and if compromised, the security of DoD mission owner’s systems/applications/information/data can be negatively affected. Additionally, compromised CSOs and DoD mission owner’s systems/applications can negatively affect a customer’s endpoint and network if malicious mobile code is served by (downloaded from) these systems. While DoD mobile code policies are under revision, CNSS and DoD has identified mobile code in categories as follows: Category 1: Mobile code technologies that exhibit a broad functionality, allowing unmediated access to the workstation, server, and remote system services and resources. Category 1 mobile code technologies have and pose known security vulnerabilities with few or no countermeasures once executing. Category 2: Mobile code technologies that have full functionality, allowing mediated access to the workstation, server, and remote system services and resources. Category 2 mobile code technologies have and pose known security vulnerabilities, however, known fine grained, periodic, or continuous countermeasures/safeguards exist. Category 3: Mobile code technologies that have limited functionality, with no capability for unmediated access to the workstation, server, and remote system services and resources. Category 3 mobile code technologies may have a history of having and posing known security vulnerabilities, but also support known fine grained, periodic, or continuous countermeasures/safeguards. Emerging Mobile Code Technologies: All mobile code technologies, systems, platforms, or languages whose capabilities and threat level have not yet undergone a risk assessment and been categorized as described above. While most of the compliance with DoD Mobile Code policy is the responsibility of the mission owner, SC-18 (2) states “The organization ensures that the acquisition, development, and use of mobile code to be deployed in information systems meets organization-defined mobile code requirements”. The following applies to DoD IS: (a) Emerging mobile code technologies that have not undergone a risk assessment and been assigned to a Risk Category by the CIO are not used. (b) Category 1 mobile code is signed with a code signing certificate; use of unsigned Category 1 mobile code is prohibited; use of Category 1 mobile code technologies that cannot block or disable unsigned mobile code (e.g., Windows Scripting Host) is prohibited. (c) Category 2 mobile code which executes in a constrained environment without access to system resources (e.g., Windows registry, file system, system parameters, and network connections to other than the originating host) may be used. (d) Category 2 mobile code that does not execute in a constrained environment may be used when obtained from a trusted source over an assured channel (e.g., SIPRNet, SSL connection, S/MIME, code is signed with an approved code signing certificate). (e) Category 3 (mobile code having limited functionality, with no capability for unmediated access to the services and resources of a computing platform) mobile code may be used. DoD expects the CSP to enact similar Mobile Code Policies for SC-18 (2) for their organizational IT systems and the infrastructure supporting their CSO(s) for the protection of the CSO(s), mission owners’ systems/applications/information/data in the CSO. Furthermore, DoD expects that the CSP’s CSO will not enable or permit the download of unapproved/risky mobile code, for the protection of the CSO’s end users as well as Mission Owner’s and their end user’s systems and networks. SC-18 (2) is under consideration for addition to the FedRAMP+ baseline for all impact levels. Similarly, SC-18 (3) and SC-18 (4) have been assigned values in Table D-2. These are currently in the set of SLA controls to be considered by mission owners for inclusion in the SLA/Contract. These too, are under consideration for addition to the FedRAMP+ baseline for all impact levels. Mission owners systems/applications must not download and execute mobile code except as permitted above, and must not enable or permit the download of unapproved/risky mobile code, for the protection of the system’s/application’s end users as well as their end user’s systems and networks. 		
5.17								Registration and Connection Approval for Cloud Based Systems/Applications This section provides information on the various registrations required for cloud based systems/applications in addition to PPSM registration discussed in Section 5.15, Ports, Protocols, Services, Management and Cloud Based Systems/Applications. 		
5.17.1								DISA Systems/Network Approval Process (SNAP) All mission owners are required to register all cloud based systems/applications; their CSP/CSO, MCD, and connection method in the DISA Systems/Network Approval Process (SNAP)96 database cloud module. This registration will enable these systems/applications to be connected to the DISN and is crucial for the situational awareness of the cybersecurity defense community tasked with protecting the DODIN, DoD information, and the mission owners cloud based systems/applications. 		
5.17.2								DoD DMZ Whitelist The DoD DMZ Whitelist implementation supports USCYBERCOM’s TASKORD 12-0371 and subsequent FRAGOs which support the operation of the DoD DMZ program. If all or a portion of the mission owners cloud-based level 4/5 systems/applications connected through the BCAP are to be internet accessible, traffic is required to traverse the DISN IAPs. The system’s/application’s URLs/IP addresses must be registered with the DoD DMZ whitelist. traffic that will typically traverse the IAP is management traffic for level 2 off-premises systems/applications and for user plane traffic to/from level 4/5 systems/applications that are internet facing. Such traffic and IP addresses may be blocked if not registered in the whitelist. Mission owners using IL4/5 I/PaaS CSOs connected to NIPRNet via the BCAP that need all or a portion of their application to be accessible from the internet are responsible for obtaining separate IP ranges for the internet-facing portion from those used for NIPRNet access and for registering the internet-facing addresses in the DMZ whitelist. Mission owners using IL4/5 P/SaaS CSOs (where they do not have control over the environment) connected to NIPRNet via the BCAP that need all or a portion of their application to be accessible from the internet are responsible for assisting the CSP in obtaining separate IP ranges for the internet-facing portion from those used for NIPRNet access and for registering the internet-facing addresses in the DMZ whitelist. The DMZ whitelist can be found on SIPRNet at https://niprdmzwhitelist.csd.disa.smil.mil/home.aspx. There is a whitelist users guide available via the “Help” link. Mission owners may need to contact their DoD component’s point of contact to have their entry added to the whitelist.		
5.17.3								Select and Native Programming Data Input System- Information Technology (SNaP-IT) In compliance with the DoD memo, "Updated Guidance on the Acquisition and Use of Commercial Cloud Computing Services," 15 Dec 2014, DoD Components will report all appropriate information within the Select and Native Programming Data Input SystemInformation Technology (SNaP-IT)97 as directed in DoD CIO annual IT budget guidance for each used cloud computing service. SNaP-IT is the authoritative DoD database used for publishing the DoD IT Budget estimates to Congress and the OMB Circular A-11 Section 53 and Section 300 exhibits to OMB for Information Technology. To comply, components MUST respond to the SNaP-IT Profile questions for the Exhibit 53 into two submissions; the Exhibit 53A, 'Agency IT Investment Portfolio Summary', and the Exhibit 53C, the 'Agency Cloud Computing Spending Summary'. Components must identify whether a cloud computing option was evaluated for each investment, and provide detail as instructed. Components fulfill their requirement for all Exhibits 53s by completing their SNaP-IT Profile, Resource, and Budget Support Data for each component investment.		
5.18								Supply Chain Risk Management Assessment The DoD selected FedRAMP+ control SA-12 addresses supply chain risk management (SCRM) while SA-19 deals with component authenticity. The acquisition of system components and software that are counterfeit, unreliable, or contain malicious logic or code is of great concern to DoD for all products supporting the processing, storage, and transmission of CUI and classified information. This concern extends to cloud computing. As part of the CSO’s DoD PA assessment package (if not already provided for the FedRAMP PATO or Agency ATO), the CSP will provide a SCRM plan outlining their supply chain assessment/management and component authenticity process and measures taken such that they are not acquiring system components and software that are counterfeit, unreliable, or contain malicious logic or code and incorporating them into the CSO infrastructure or its management plane. The CSP’s SCRM plan for how the CSP implements SA-12 and SA-19 will be assessed and approved during the DoD PA assessment process for all impact level 4, 5, and 6 CSOs.		
5.19								Electronic Mail Protections CSPs that operate/offer email servers/services must provide for appropriate email protections within the CSO. Mission owners must use these services or provide for alternate capabilities when contracting for email services. Such protections will include, but may not be limited to, email hygiene or scanning for and elimination of malicious content and spam filtering as a minimum. 		
5.19.1								Electronic Mail Protections IAW TASKORD 12-0920 This section addresses compliance with US CYBERCOM Task Order (TASKORD) 12-0920 regarding SMTP traffic between email systems whether they be a CSO or are agency provided. US CYBERCOM Task Order (TASKORD) 12-0920 requires the use of the Enterprise E-Mail Security Gateway (EEMSG) for all email inbound from, or outbound to, the internet. It further requires email outbound from one DoD Component’s email servers to another component’s email servers to pass through the EEMSG. The EEMSG only deals with server to server email traffic, it does not deal with client to server traffic. All DoD components are required to use the EEMSG unless a waiver is in place. In the event a waiver is in place, the DoD component must use their own email security gateway. Therefore, IAW the full TASKORD: • All email transfers inbound through the IAP from an external email server destined to a L4/5 email server in a mission owner’s enclave within a CSO via a BCAP must pass through the EEMSG inbound protections. • All email transfers sent from a L4/5 email server in a mission owner’s enclave within a CSO via a BCAP and through the IAP to an external email server must pass through the EEMSG outbound protections • All email transfers sent from a L4/5 email server in a mission owner’s enclave within a CSO via a BCAP to email servers in a DoD Component’s data center enclave must pass through the EEMSG outbound protections. • All email transfers sent from email servers in DoD component's data center enclave to a L4/5 email server in a mission owner’s enclave within a CSO via a BCAP must pass through the EEMSG outbound protections. This requirement and interpretation of the TASKORD is based on the fact that the mission owner’s environment in any CSO is considered a DoD enclave that may include an email server either as the primary service SaaS offering or as an adjunct service to a PaaS/SaaS, or may be instantiated by the mission owner in IaaS. In the event two mission owners use the same email SaaS and email servers, there is no need for EEMSG protections for email between the different mission owners’ users. However, in the event the CSO implements different servers/enclaves for different mission owners, the CSO must include an email hygiene/protective service through which email transfers between these servers/enclaves will route. In this case the server-to-server email traffic will remain within the CSP’s infrastructure and not traverse the CAP or EEMSG. Similarly, mission owners that implement email servers in IaaS or leverage a PaaS feature within their CSO based enclaves will follow the same rules as above for SaaS and must provide for email hygiene/protective service within the CSO for enclave to mission owner enclave to mission owner enclave traffic or route such traffic through the BCAP and EEMSG. All BCAPs must support mission owner’s and implement the appropriate routing of server-toserver email traffic to/from the EEMSG capability at the CAP end of the connection for all CSOs that contain an email server. This includes routing to/from such servers and the IAP for email servers that are external and internet connected. This is a CSO connection approval requirement. However, it is ultimately a mission owner responsibility for TASKORD compliance when they use a CSO or implement a system/application in IaaS/PaaS. Note: As of this release of the CC SRG, EEMSG does not currently inspect intra-enclave email. Therefore, the above requirements do not apply to email traffic that remains within the DISN and Mission Owner enclaves in a CSO, until EEMSG does inspect intra-enclave email. That said, the requirement for EEMSG to inspect all email traffic to/from the internet-based email servers still applies. 		
6								CYBERSPACE DEFENSE AND INCIDENT RESPONSE NOTICE: This release of the CC SRG has been coordinated with the new cyberspace defense lexicon defined in DoD Joint Publication 3-12 (R), "Cyberspace Operations" and DoDI 8530.01, “Cybersecurity Activities Support to DoD Information Network Operations”. Additionally, due to publication of the DoDI 8530.01 and the replacement of the DRAFT Cloud CND CONOPS (rescinded) with DRAFT DoDM 8530.01, “Cyberspace Activity Support to DODIN Operations and Defensive Cyber Operations – Internal Defensive Measures (DCO-IDM)” all releasable content from DoDM 8530.01 applicable to CSPs will be included in a subsequent release. Mission owners and others will refer to the DoDM 8530.01 when published. Cyberspace defense addresses the defense and protection of networks and information systems (ISs), detection of threats, and response to incidents. Cyber situational awareness improves the quality and timeliness of collaborative decision-making regarding the employment, protection, and defense of DoD systems and data. This section addresses critical cyberspace defense actions; roles and responsibilities; incident reporting and response; and other cybersecurity processes.		
6.1								Overview of Cyberspace Defense DoD operates a cybersecurity structure as defined in DoDI 8530.01, "Cybersecurity Activities Support to DoD Information Network Operations”. The structure consists of United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) and Joint Forces Headquarters (JFHQ-DODIN) at the top organizational level and a network of Cybersecurity Service Providers (CSSPs) that have been accredited by USCYBERCOM IAW DoD policy. DoD integrates and employs a number of cybersecurity activities to support DODIN operations and DCO internal defensive measures in response to vulnerabilities and threats, including (1) vulnerability assessment and analysis (VAA); (2) vulnerability management (VM); (3) malware protection (MP); (4) continuous monitoring (CM); (5) cyber incident handling (IR); (6) DODIN user activity monitoring (UAM) for the DoD Insider Threat Program; and (7) warning intelligence and attack sensing and warning (AS&W). Contracts, MOAs, support agreements, international agreements, or other applicable agreements must identify specific operations responsibilities, cybersecurity requirements, protection requirements for DoD data, and points of contact for mandatory reporting of security incidents. Given the requirement for cybersecurity compliance, cloud service provider, cybersecurity service provider and the mission owner security responsibilities should be clearly documented in contract or service level agreement. Note: An example of maintaining the security posture of a mission owner’s system is the application of patches/upgrades and IAVM compliance. This is a mission owner requirement as identified by policy. However, in a SaaS environment the operating system is managed by the CSP, as such the CSP would be required to apply operating system patches.		
6.2								Concept Changes for Information Impact Levels for Cloud Computing With the move to commercial cloud computing, the DoD will need to deploy modified network defense capabilities and processes specific to the cloud environment. As described in Section 3.2, information Impact Levels. DoD has defined information impact levels commensurate to the risk and type of data, with each higher level warranting greater protections. With Impact Level 2 data, the overall value of the data is not mission critical or sensitive in nature, thus it may not warrant the same level of protections as higher impact level data, while still needing protection. Recognizing that the data at impact level 2 has minimal requirements for confidentiality, emphasis must be placed on integrity and availability that achieve a level of security and risk acceptable to the responsible AO. User connectivity to the information system flows through the CSP’s internet connection. If the boundary defense is not implemented by the CSP, then the mission owner will be responsible and accountable and must coordinate with their DoD CSSP, who will coordinate with JFHQ-DODIN, for appropriate boundary defense. Protection capabilities supporting the mission system at the system/host/application level will be provided by a combination of the CSSP, mission system administrators, and the CSP (especially for SaaS). Refer to Section 5.10.6, Mission Owner System/Application Requirements using IaaS/PaaS for related boundary requirements. CSPs are expected to protect their SaaS CSOs (and PaaS CSOs where the Mission Owner does not have control) by applying the appropriate boundary protections and cyber defense services. Refer to Section 5.10.3, CSP Service Architecture and subsections for additional information and CSP requirements for all service models I/P/SaaS. Impact level 4 and above data presents greater risk and thus necessitates the need for enterprise defense mechanisms and data collection that enable robust monitoring, event correlation, and analytics. With impact level 4 and above data, the DISN boundary is essentially extended through a connection between an authorized DoD CAP and the CSP’s network infrastructure supporting the DoD mission. Therefore, an event may be detected through a few different entities: the CSP through monitoring of their CSO; the mission administrators or owners; or the CSSPs that are supporting the monitoring of the mission and the boundary connection. All entities must work together to quickly investigate and respond to incidents. The protection of a DoD BCAP is supported by organizations performing boundary cyberspace actions.		
6.2.1								Boundary Cyberspace Defense Actions Boundary cyberspace defense (BCD) Actions monitor and defend the connections to/from CSPs into the DISN via an authorized BCAP. BCD Actions guard against the risk that each CSP interconnection poses to the DODIN individually, as well as cross-CSP analysis for all connections flowing through an individual BCAP. While these actions focus on the connections through a particular BCAP, cross-BCAP analysis is warranted to determine if a threat extends beyond a single CSP or BCAP.		
6.2.2								Mission Cyberspace Defense Actions Mission cyberspace defense (MCD) Actions performed by the DoD CSSPs provide services to mission owners’ cloud-based mission systems/applications and virtual networks. Organizations performing MCD Actions may provide services to cloud-based mission systems/applications and virtual networks instantiated in multiple CSPs and multiple CSOs98. While some of these services are mandated to be delivered by the CSSP, other MCD actions may be delivered by a third-party cybersecurity provider, to include the CSP. Wherever the latter is true, the coordination between the third-party cybersecurity provider and the CSSP needs to be explicitly documented in the mission owner SLA. MCD Actions will typically be executed by the CSSP used by the mission owner’s component for their non-cloud-based ISs; however, mission owners can choose to use and fund any certified CSSP for execution of MCD Actions; C2 relationships between organic CSSPs and otherwise employed forces will need to be coordinated by the mission owner.		
6.3								Cyberspace Defense Actions The following is a list of cyberspace defense actions and their responsibilities as it relates to cloud operations. • DODIN Cyberspace Defense (DCD) Actions: The primary objective of the organization that performs DCD Actions is to oversee a coordinated response to DODIN-wide attacks. DCD builds a broad picture of the operating environment across mission owners, MCDs, BCDs, CSOs, and CSPs. The DCD identifies patterns of incidents or events, consolidates related incident tickets, directs mitigations, and assigns DODIN Cyber Protection Teams (CPTs) to focus efforts on a specific threat or adversary. Specific cyberspace defense actionsinclude: o Protect the DODIN and DoD mission systems in commercial cloud infrastructure through cross-BCAP correlation and analysis of events/data o Direct or recommend cybersecurity actions regarding DODIN-wide incident and system health reporting involving a BCAP or CSP o Establish and maintain external communications with the CSP for DODINwide incidents and ensure internal DoD communications are established between all entities, which includes the MCD and BCD o Interface with US-CERT to obtain relevant CSP information; ensure cross-sharing of information across all organizations performing BCD/MCD Actions • Boundary Cyberspace Defense (BCD) Actions: The primary objective of organizations that perform BCD Actions is to protect the Defense Information Systems Network (DISN) from events or incidents that use public, private, hybrid, or community clouds. BCD Actions support CSSPs performing MCD Actions in their objectives of defending DoD systems, applications, and data hosted in the cloud. specific cyberspace defense actionsinclude: o Protect the DISN via the BCAP o Provide timely access to BCD-collected indications and warnings relevant to organizations performing MCD Actions o Support DCD Actions to identify correlations between related events or incidents that impact multiple Mission Owners, CSOs, or CSP • Mission Cyberspace Defense (MCD) Actions: The primary objective of organizations that perform MCD Actions is to defend mission owners’ systems, applications, and data hosted in the Cloud. MCD Actions are performed by cybersecurity service providers (CSSPs) on behalf of their organic organizations and subscribers. Specific cyberspace defense actionsinclude: o Analyze cyber incidents and events for mission owners o Monitor, protect, and defend mission owners’ cloud-based systems, applications, and virtual networks in the CSP’s CSOs infrastructure o Monitor, protect, and defend mission owners’ cloud-based data in the CSO o Defend all connections to the CSO, whether via BCAP, Virtual Private Network (VPN), IAP, direct internet access to public servers, or other o Monitor privileged actions (e.g., cloud management or mission owner application administration) and monitor for events or incidents against the mission owner applications (e.g., Structured Query Language (SQL) injection) o Support DCD efforts to identify correlations between related events or incidents that impact multiple mission owners, CSOs, or CSPs o Ensure internal DoD communications are established between all entities which include the mission owner and other organizations performing MCD and BCD Actions o Provide visibility and awareness of cyber incidents or events impacting mission owner systems, applications, virtual networks, and data to JFHQ-DODIN		
6.4								Cyberspace Defense Roles and Responsibilities The following is a list of the cyberspace defense roles and responsibilities as they relate to cloud operations. • JFHQ-DODIN: JFHQ-DODIN will perform DCD actions and has direct tasking authority over DoD Components. JFHQ-DODIN, as part of USCYBERCOM, has legal authority to collaborate with entities external to DoD, such as the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) • DoD Components: Service cyber components, defense agencies, and DISA may perform MCD Actions in support of their mission owners; and BCD actions when they have the responsibility of operating, monitoring, and maintaining aBCAP • Mission Administrators: Administrators of mission owner’s cloud-based systems, applications, and virtual networks; responsible for: o Following the directives and orders from the mission owner o Maintaining and patching the cloud-based mission systems, applications, and virtual networks o Installing and maintaining protective measures for the cloud-based mission systems, applications, and virtual networks Note: As stated in Section 6.1, Overview of Cyberspace Defense, some DoD Components might transfer some or all of these responsibilities to organizations performing MCD actions • Cloud Service Provider (CSP): CSPs provide their own cyberspace defense services for the underlying infrastructure made available for their customer’s (DoD mission owner's) applications, systems, and virtual networks (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS). In effect, the CSP will function as an extension of the mission owner, who has transferred responsibility for maintaining that infrastructure to the CSP through an SLA for those services. At a minimum, CSPs responsibility is defined in the DoD CIO memorandum, “Department of Defense Cybersecurity Activities Performed for Cloud Service Offerings”, Attachment 199. • Mission Owners: Individuals/organizations responsible for the overall mission environment, ensuring that the functional and cyberspace defense requirements of the system are being met. Mission owners, as the CSO subscribers to the CSPs, have a contractual relationship to the CSPs. Mission owners can optionally expand cyberspace defense relevant reporting to their organizations performing MCD and BCD actions by including such language in their service level agreements (SLAs). At a minimum, mission owners responsibility is defined in the DoD CIO memorandum, “Department of Defense Cybersecurity Activities Performed for Cloud Service Offerings”, Attachment 1100.		
6.5								Cyber Incident Reporting and Response Two key definitions related to this section as reflected in the CNSSI 4009, IA Glossary, are as follows: • Cyber incident: Actions taken through the use of computer networks that result in an actual or potentially adverse effect on an information system and/or the information residing therein. Refer to incident. • Incident: An assessed occurrence that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an information system; or the information the system processes, stores, or transmits; or that constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of security policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies. For the purposes of this SRG, incident and cyber incident interchangeably. FedRAMP, through the selection and implementation of IR-6, requires CSPs to report cyber incidents to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team101 (US-CERT) and the consuming federal agencies. For CSOs that are multitenant or otherwise shared across federal agencies outside of the DoD (Impact Levels 2 through 5), incidents will be reported to US-CERT as required by FedRAMP, in parallel with reporting to DoD. For CSPs providing dedicated infrastructure to the DoD (Impact Levels 4 and above), incidents regarding that infrastructure and CSOs will not be reported to US-CERT, but directly to the DoD. USCYBERCOM/JFHQ-DODIN will handle coordination with US-CERT and other entities as appropriate. The DoD incident reporting process is described in Section 6.5.3, Incident Reporting Mechanism. All CSPs actively supporting DoD missions will be supported by one or more organizations performing MCD Actions. The CSSP contracted to perform MCD Actions will be the DoD point of contact with whom the CSP’s operational entity will coordinate responses to incidents affecting the security posture of the CSP and the CSP’s cloud service offerings. The organizations performing MCD Actions will coordinate with the organizations performing BCD Actions as appropriate. Corresponding Security Controls: IR-4, IR-5, IR-6	IR-4, IR-5, IR-6	
6.5.1								Incident Response Plans and Addendums CSPs will provide, either as part of their Incident Response Plan or through an Incident Response Plan Addendum, their approach to fulfilling DoD Cyberspace Defense integration requirements. CSPs will make their plan or addendum available to DISA for review and approval as a condition of its PA and inclusion in the DoD Cloud Service Catalog. CSPs will update and deliver the Incident Response Plan Addendum (if used) in conjunction with updates and deliveries of their Incident Response Plan, as required by the FedRAMP selected security control IR-1. A CSP must specifically address cyber incidents and data breaches, where a “breach” or cyber incident includes the loss of control, compromise, unauthorized acquisition, unauthorized access, or any similar term referring to situations where any unauthorized person has access or potential access to government data, whether in electronic or non-electronic form, for any unauthorized purpose. CSPs must ensure that the plan or addendum addresses all incidents regardless of the time, day, or location of the incident and must provide for notice to the Government of any breach of its data. The plan or addendum must incorporate any other policies or procedures that the government may require to be followed in the event of an incident, including, but not limited to: • To whom within the government, the incident will be reported IAW the incident reporting process defined in Section 6.5.3, Incident Reporting Mechanism • Specific steps to be taken in order to mitigate or remedy the incident, including time periods for taking such steps (e.g., reporting of PII data breaches within one hour) • How and under what circumstances any individuals or entities affected by an incident will be notified and by whom • Any other special instructions for handling computer security incidents affecting, or potentially affecting US government data; consistent with guidance and policy directives issued by DoD, NIST, US-CERT and CNSS for incident management, classification, and remediation; or other applicable law, regulation, order, or policy. Corresponding Security Controls: IR-8	IR-8	
6.5.2								Information Requirements, Categories, Timelines, and Formats Defending DoD missions and systems is a shared responsibility that requires all entities (CSPs, organizations performing MCD or BCD actions, mission owners and mission administrators) to work collectively as a team. An event may be detected by any of following entities, depending upon the connection architecture (direct internet or through a CAP): • CSP personnel through monitoring of their CSO (especially for PaaS/SaaS); • Mission administrators or owners (includes the CSP for PaaS/SaaS); • Supporting organizations performing MCD Actions through monitoring; • Supporting organizations performing BCD Actions via BCAP monitoring. All entities must work together to quickly investigate and respond to events and incidents. CSP’s reporting requirements to DoD will align with the reporting lexicon used by US-CERT for the broader Federal Government reporting requirements. Incident notifications should include a description of the incident and as much of the following information as possible: • Contract information to include contract number, USG contracting officer(s) contact information, contract clearance level, etc. • Contact information for the impacted and reporting organizations as well as the MCD. • Details describing any vulnerabilities involved (i.e., common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE) identifiers) • Date/Time of occurrence, including time zone • Date/Time of detection and identification, including time zone • Related indicators (e.g., hostnames, domain names, network traffic characteristics, registry keys, X.509 certificates, MD5 file signatures) • Threat vectors, if known (see threat vector taxonomy and cause analysis flowchart within the US-CERT Federal Incident Notification Guidelines)  Prioritization factors (i.e., functional impact, information impact, and recoverability as defined flowchart within the US-CERT Federal Incident Notification Guidelines102) • Source and destination internet protocol (IP) address, port, and protocol • Operating System(s) affected • Mitigating factors (e.g., full disk encryption or two-factor authentication) • Mitigation actions taken, if applicable • System Function(s) (e.g., web server, domain controller, or workstation) • Physical system location(s) (e.g., Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, California) • Sources, methods, or tools used to identify the incident (e.g., Intrusion Detection System or audit log analysis) • Any additional information relevant to the incident and not included above. Initial incident reports must be submitted within one hour of discovery with follow-on information provided as available. Initial reports may be incomplete to facilitate communication and teamwork between the CSP and the organizations performing MCD/BCD Actions. CSPs should balance the necessity of timely reporting (incomplete reports with critical information) versus complete reports (those with all blocks completed). Timely reporting is vital, and complete information should follow as details emerge. Note: These requirements are applicable to all systems at all information impact levels. The CSP must follow these requirements when integrating with DoD organizations performing CSSP.		
6.5.3								Incident Reporting Mechanism DoD CSSP’s will report all incidents using the Joint Incident Management System (JIMS) IAW normal DoD processes. The following requirements are consistent with DFARS Clause 252.204-7012(c) as updated for Cloud Computing when finalized. Level 2/4/5 commercial CSPs will report all incidents via the online defense industrial Base (DIB) cyber incident collection format (ICF)103 . Use of the online format is preferred. Access to this format requires a DoD-approved medium assurance external certificate authority (ECA) certificate. If you are unable to access this format, please call (877) 838-2174 or email: DCISE@DC3.mil. The CSP must include the DoD missions affected by the incident when distributing this report. The DoD mission owners and security POCs (CSSPs) and other entities that might have a role, for example contract managers, etc. Once the report is received, the CSSP performing MCD actions will initiate the DoD reporting process via JIMS. In the event of an incident against a classified system, CSPs will use SIPRNet email or secure phone/fax to report and coordinate incidents as specified. Level 6 Commercial CSPs will report all incidents to the organization performing MCD Actions using SIPRNet email or secure phone/fax to report and coordinate incidents as specified. Existing notification mechanisms of a CSP that are already in place to communicate between the CSP and its customers for some or all classes of cyberspace defense information may be used, provided those mechanisms demonstrate a level of assurance equivalent to the listed encrypted mechanisms for the confidentiality and integrity of the information. Corresponding Security Controls: IR-6, IR-8	IR-6, IR-8	
6.5.4								Digital Forensics in the Cloud and Support for Law Enforcement/Criminal Investigation Incidents and compromises will happen. When they do, they must be reported and then forensically analyzed to gain detailed information regarding how it occurred, how to prevent it or protect the system in the future, and, if possible, determine who is responsible. Incident information must be gathered and handled in a manner that will support legal prosecution if needed. As such it must be protected from alteration from the time it is captured until it is no longer needed. Support for forensics is shared between the mission owner and the CSP to various degrees depending on the service type. Digital forensics in the cloud has many challenges as described by NIST in Draft National Institute of Standards and Technology Interagency or Internal Report (NISTIR) 8006, Cloud Computing Forensic Science Challenges104.This section of the CC SRG provides initial guidance regarding the DoD requirements for enabling and performing cloud forensics and supporting law enforcement and criminal investigation (LE/CE) activities. The following requirements apply to all information impact levels 2 through 6. Corresponding security controls: IR-4, IR-5(1)	IR-4, IR-5 (1)	
6.5.4.1								Malicious Software CSPs or their subcontractors that discover and isolate malicious software in connection with a reported cyber incident shall securely submit the malicious software to the organization performing MCD actions for analysis in addition to any other analysis organization employed by the CSP. The means of submission will be coordinated with the organization performing MCD Actions. The DoD cyberspace defense community will use their analysis to develop detection signatures and mitigation measures to be applied to DoD networks and mission owner’s systems. Analysis results will be shared with the CSP if permissible and the appropriate communication channels exist.	SI-3 (10)	
6.5.4.2								Incident Information Collection, Preservation, and Protection Under all service types including SaaS, when a CSP discovers a cyber incident has occurred within infrastructure and/or CSO for which they are responsible, in conjunction with initial incident reporting, the CSP shall capture, preserve, and protect images and state of all known affected systems/servers/workstations supporting the CSO and the customer. This includes system logs, volatile memory captures, and hard drive (physical or virtual) images. The CSP shall also preserve and protect all relevant network logs, as well as all available network monitoring/packet capture data. This information must be collected as soon as possible after the discovery. Under IaaS, when a mission owner discovers a cyber-incident has occurred within their systems/applications/virtual networks, they will work with their organization performing MCD actions and CSP to capture, preserve, and protect images and state of all known affected virtual machines which they manage as well as any network logs, and network monitoring/packet capture data generated by their virtual network(s). This includes system logs, volatile memory captures, and virtual hard drive images. While the virtual hard drive image of a compromised VM is typically easy to preserve as a new image is placed into service, tools run on the compromised VM before it is shut down are typically used to capture and package the system logs and/or volatile memory and detailed procedures are followed. An example of this is the DISA Incident Response and Recovery Team’s (IRRT) First Responder’s Guide and webpage105, which makes software tools available for Windows and UNIX/Linux based systems to collect the necessary supporting information. These tools work within the VM and the volatile memory allocated to it. They will not compromise other customers’ information or VMs running on the same physical hardware, which may be a concern for other tools. Each organization performing MCD actions is required to have and use similar procedures and tools. The mission owner and/or the organization performing MCD Actions must subsequently coordinate with the CSP to collect relevant infrastructure logs in support of investigating the incident. Alternately, the CSP may/should also provide similar tools/capabilities that will work in their environment. Under PaaS and SaaS, a mission owner, the organization performing MCD actions, or the CSP may detect an incident. Each party must work with the others to collect the necessary forensic information from the areas of the service each manages. It may be unlikely that the Mission Owner will be able to run the tools discussed under IaaS above, however, the CSP must provide similar tools/capabilities that will work in their environment. Under PaaS, if the mission owner manages their contracted servers (VMs or otherwise) OS and platform applications, it is their responsibility to perform the capture, preserve, and protect functions in coordination with their organization performing MCD Actions as described under IaaS on their own or using tools provided by the CSP. If, on the other hand, the CSP manages the CSO servers, OS, and/or platform applications, then the CSP must perform the capture, preserve, and protect functions. The CSP will then do a dual report to share their results with the mission owner and security POC (CSSP) performing MCD actions. Under SaaS, the CSP must perform the capture, preserve, and protect functions. The CSP will then share their results with the mission owner’s CSSP performing MCD actions. All captured incident information is digital evidence. Upon collection of digital evidence, the original and copied information must be hashed to validate the integrity of the copy initially and in the future. To be effective, all incident capture should be performed using automation IAW IR-5(1). The CSP must provide an automated capability that supports incident capture and protection from modification or deletion, which must support the CSP’s investigation of incidents within their own infrastructure and in customer’s CSO environments. An interface to the capability must be made available to the customer in support of the customer’s incident response activities as needed in their environments within the CSO. All such automation must capture the information in a manner that segregates captured information by customer such that non-DoD or non-federal information is not revealed to the incident response team or forensic/LE investigators. Likewise, the information relating to the government environment must be segregated from the information captured from the CSP’s underlying infrastructure. Once the information is captured, the automation must create one or more hashes of the data such that changes to it can be detected. The automation must then encrypt the data to preserve its confidentiality and integrity. Captured information from the CSP’s underlying infrastructure will be encrypted separately from the information captured from the government’s environment. Encryption keys will be provided to the forensic analysts and stored in such a manner that only the government has access to the keys for the information captured from the government’s environment and the CSP has access to captured data from the CSP’s underlying infrastructure. Note: At this time, some of the tools provided on the DISA IRRT website (more specifically Oscar) incorporate licensed software and may not be used by other organizations except as directed by the DISA IRRT. Mission owners must reflect these requirements in their contract/SLA with the CSP delineating specific responsibilities between the CSP and mission owner/CSSP performing MCD.

6.5.4.3								Forensics/Incident Information Chain-of-Custody for LE/CI According to NISTIR 8006, chain-of-custody is defined in legal contexts as the chronological documentation of evidence handling, which is required to avoid allegations of evidence tampering or misconduct. In the event the incident discovered by the CSP or mission owner was maliciously caused by an individual, maintaining the chain of custody over the information is critical to being able to legally reprimand or prosecute the responsible individual or organization. To support LE/CI investigations, the chain-of-custody of the captured data should be documented from end-to-end, person-to-person starting when the incident investigation begins. The individual that captures each piece or portion of the information initiates this documentation and each individual that subsequently handles the information or media containing it must continue the documentation. Chain-of custody-forms are available on the DISA IRRT website noted above or from law enforcement. While chain-of-custody documentation is important and recommended; initiating the chain-of-custody forms and procedures may only be required if the incident warrants the notification of law enforcement. In that case, the chain-of-custody forms will be initiated by law enforcement officers. If requested or subpoenaed, the CSP will make their employees available to provide attestation either via affidavits or expert testimony on the CSP’s chain-of-custody and forensic data capture/collection methods.

6.5.4.4								Digital Forensics Support by CSP toward PA Award CSPs will be evaluated for their ability to support the requirements above that are incumbent upon the CSP and for their ability to support requirements that are incumbent upon the mission owner particularly in the area of system image and state preservation. This includes capabilities and tools to support the capture and preservation of system logs, volatile memory captures, and hard drive (physical or virtual) images by the mission owner or CSP. The CSP must document their capability to support digital forensics in their Security Plan. CSP Forensics Support capabilities and their acceptability will be documented in the information supporting the PA.		
6.6								Warning, Tactical Directives, and Orders USCYBERCOM or JFHQ-DODIN disseminates warnings, tactical directives, and orders to the organizations performing BCD and MCD Actions. The organizations performing BCD and MCD actions will analyze them for their applicability to individual mission owners and CSPs, and then, as appropriate and applicable, communicate the requirements to these same mission owners and CSPs. CSPs will coordinate with the organizations performing MCD actions and mission owners to implement directives and countermeasures in compliance with timelines identified. Upon completion of actions, the organization(s) performing MCD and BCD actions will report compliance back to JFHQ-DODIN and USCYBERCOM. CSPs must be able to receive, act upon, and report compliance with directives and notifications sent by the organization performing MCD Actions on behalf of the mission owner, as required by FedRAMP selected security control SI-5.		
6.7								Continuous Monitoring/Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) Understanding existing vulnerabilities and risks within the enterprise is a key component in performing effective cyberspace defense analysis. The vulnerability reports and POA&Ms developed by the CSPs as part of continuous monitoring requirements supporting both FedRAMP and FedRAMP+ requirements will be made available to DISA’s cloud services support team and subsequently to the organizations performing MCD and BCD Actions for their collective use in providing cyberspace defense. For both FedRAMP and FedRAMP+ requirements, high and critical risk findings must be mitigated within 30 days. Moderate findings must be mitigated within 90 days. Corresponding Security Controls: CA-5, CA-7	CA-5, CA-7	
6.8								Notice of Scheduled Outages Planned outages affecting mission systems are to be coordinated through the mission owner; with the goal of minimizing impacts to the operational community. An approved outage is referred to as an authorized services interruption (ASI). CSPs must notify all affected organizations performing MCD actions of ASIs under their control when an outage starts and upon return to service. Outages or changes that affect more than one mission environment must be reported by the organization performing MCD actions to the organization performing BCD Actions to enable broader situational awareness. Mission owners and administrators are responsible for the same notifications to the organizations performing MCD actions when the ASI is under their control.		
6.9								PKI for Cyberspace Defense Purposes The DoD PKI program provides assurances of an individual’s identity, which is important in sharing information regarding C2 and cyberspace defense actions. This section outlines requirements for establishing trusted identities for CSP personnel communicating securely with DoD cyberspace defense personnel. Once an incident is reported through the process identified in Section 6.5.3, Incident Reporting Mechanism or encrypted email is to be used as the subsequent communications method, DoD PKI certificates will be required as follows: • Impact Levels 2 through 5: CSPs must preferably have either a DoD PKI certificate or a DoD- approved PKI credential for each person that needs to communicate with DoD via encrypted email. For more information on DoD-approved credentials, please see the Cyber Exchange PKI/ECA webpage106and PKI/PK Enabling (PKE) webpage107. Equivalent alternative measures will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. • Impact Level 6: CSPs serving Level 6 systems will already have SIPRNet tokens/NSS PKI certificates for their system administrators by virtue of the connection to SIPRNet. Incident response and cyberspace defense personnel will use SIPRNet tokens/certificates to communicate with DoD via encrypted email.		
6.10								Vulnerability and Threat Information Sharing Vulnerability and threat information sharing is a highly effective way for DoD to help CSPs protect and defend DoD information housed or processed in their service offerings. Government sources such as US-CERT and USCYBERCOM provide detailed vulnerability information. Several commercial sources also provide supplemental information that can be used by CSPs in further defending their infrastructure. CSPs are encouraged to leverage such knowledge sources. However, much of the information that the DoD can provide to CSPs is classified. An avenue to obtain such information follows: The Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity/Information Assurance Program108 (DIB CS/IA) is a program to enhance and supplement DIB participants’ capabilities to safeguard DoD information that resides on, or transits, DIB unclassified information systems. Under this voluntary publicprivate cybersecurity partnership, DoD and participating DIB companies share unclassified and classified cyber threat information, best practices, and mitigation strategies. While cyber incident reporting is an important component to the success of this partnership, the real value of the program is collaboration, which is key to making DoD information more secure. Membership in DIB CS/IA enables DIB participants to acquire access to DIBNet-U and DIBNetS, the unclassified and classified networks used for data sharing and collaboration. Access to DIBNet provides CSPs with access to CYBERCOM notifications, classified email, and the DIB web portals detailing classified and unclassified cyber threat information, including mitigation strategies. DIB CS/IA program membership is voluntary, although cyber incident reporting as described in Section 6.5.3, Incident Reporting Mechanism is mandatory. Eligible CSPs are encouraged to join the voluntary DIB CS/IA program to facilitate their protection of infrastructure that hosts higher-value DoD data and systems. Note: DoD CSPs are already integrated into the Cyberspace Defense communications architecture and receive unclassified CYBERCOM notifications via established channels.
