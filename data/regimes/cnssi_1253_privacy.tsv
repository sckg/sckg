AC-2	+EGVR	+EGVR	+EGVR	+EGR	Justification to Select: Account management is a critical function for developing and implementing an access control framework that is appropriate for the information contained in systems and applications. When implemented effectively, the access control framework provides the necessary constructs for controlling access to PII, limiting disclosure of records about individuals to only those system and application users that have a need for the information to perform their job functions. The purpose of this guidance is to establish requirements for user access to PHI and PII. Low PII Confidentiality Impact Level Control Extension: Prohibit use of guest, anonymous, and shared accounts for providing access to PII. Notify account managers within an organization-defined timeframe when temporary accounts are no longer required or when information system users are terminated or transferred or information system usage or need-to-know/need-to-share changes. Prior to granting access to PII, users demonstrate a need for the PII in the performance of the user's duties. Moderate and High PII Confidentiality Impact Level Control Extension: Apply the Low PII confidentiality impact level Control Extension. Implement access controls within the information system based on users' or user group's need for access to PII in the performance of their duties.

AC-3	+EGR	+EGR	+EGR	+GR	Justification to Select: Access to PII is more effectively controlled when access controls are considered during system design and built-into or enforced by the system (i.e. automated controls). Well-designed, automated access controls (e.g., mandatory access control (MAC), discretionary access control (DAC), role-based access control (RBAC), or attribute-based access control (ABAC)) limit user access to information according to defined access policies, which helps ensure the security and confidentiality of the PII contained in the system. Low, Moderate, and High PII Confidentiality Impact Level Control Extension: Organizations shall control access to PII through access enforcement mechanisms. For example, implement role-based access controls and configure access controls so that each user can access only the pieces of information necessary for the user's role or only permit users to access PII through an application that restricts their access to the PII the users require, instead of allowing users direct access to a database or files containing PII.

AC-5		+GR	+GR	+GR	Justification to Select: Separation of duties aligns privileges with appropriate roles with the idea that duties are split between roles in such a way as to reduce the risk of malevolent or inappropriate behaviors based on access. Implementing this control helps reduce the risk of inappropriate access to PII (e.g., separating employees that perform security investigations from mission and business functions). Privacy Overlay 29 Attachment 6 to Appendix F 04/20/2015 Moderate and High PII Confidentiality Impact Level Supplemental Guidance: Separation of duties is implemented by designating a selected set of administrators the capability to set user permissions to PII and PHI information, while those administrators do not themselves have access to the PII and PHI. The principle of separation of duties is significant for developers as well as for operational system administrators. Related Control: AC-6 PHI Supplemental Guidance: HIPAA requires the separation of duties to ensure that checks and balances are designed into the system to limit the effect of any given end user to control the entire process. Roles and responsibilities should be divided so that a single end user cannot subvert a critical process. This practice divides the tasks related to maintaining system security among different personnel such that no single individual could compromise PHI. Related Control: AC-6.

PHI Supplemental Guidance: Under HIPAA, there are three requirements that minimize the risk to privacy of using PHI for research, testing or training. The first is the de- identification of information that results in that information no longer being classified as PHI. There are only two methods for de-identification permitted by HIPAA. For specific details on those two methods see 45 C.F.R. §164.514(a). The second requirement is commonly referred to as the "Minimum Necessary Rule" which limits the amount of PHI used or disclosed to that which is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose for which the request for information is made. See 45 §C.F.R. §164.514(d). The third requirement allows covered entities to use or disclose a limited data set, which excludes certain direct identifiers. Unlike de-identified data, a limited data set is PHI and any use or disclosure must meet the requirements of HIPAA. See 45 C.F.R. §164.514(e).

Second, the organization must determine whether a privacy breach should be reported, based on the resultant privacy risk to the organization and to affected individuals. The Best Judgment Standard effectively imposes a requirement on organizations to develop and implement a risk-based analysis for privacy breaches to determine whether the breach needs to be reported. In the context of breach reporting, the purpose of the Best Judgment Standard is to limit reporting to those privacy breaches which meet the organization's risk threshold. Conversely, under the Best Judgment Standard, organizations are not required to report privacy breaches that do not meet their risk threshold. The policy provides an example of implementing the Best Judgment Standard as discarding a document with the author's name on the front and no other PII into an office trashcan, positing that this probably would fall below and organization's risk threshold and would not need to be reported. OMB M-07-16 does not provide bright line rules to define what is considered "sensitive PII" using the common dictionary definition approach to the language in the memo – and under what circumstances a privacy breach should be reported, both because it would be a futile effort to attempt to delineate or predict the myriad potential contexts and situations, and agencies are in the best position to know and understand the relevant circumstances of their PII to determine which PII is sensitive and which breaches create risk.

TR-1	+GR	+GR	+GR	+GR	Justification for Selection: Providing the appropriate notification of privacy practices to the individual enables the individual to make an informed decision when they provide their consent. Low, Moderate, and High PII Confidentiality Impact Level Supplemental Guidance: The Privacy Notice described by OMB M-99-18, Privacy Policies on Federal Web Sites, frequently referred to on organization websites as a "Privacy Policy" or "Privacy and Security Notice," is intended as a broad notice of website privacy policies and general website use and does not meet the requirement for specific notice when collecting PII. When PII is maintained (including collection) in a system of records that is covered by the Privacy Act, the organization must provide a "Privacy Act Statement" (PAS) to the individual at the time of collection that meets the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. §552a(e)(3), unless the organization has published a rule exempting that system of records from the (e)(3) notice provision in accordance with subsection (j) of the Privacy Act. If the PII is not maintained in a system of records under the Privacy Act, a privacy notice should be provided which describes the privacy practices associated with that PII, including, but not limited to, the way the PII is protected, how it is used, and whether it is shared. This type of privacy notice must not be labeled as a "Privacy Act Statement." For example, several organizations refer to this notice type as a "Privacy Advisory." PHI Supplemental Guidance: The HIPAA Privacy Rule also requires a privacy notice referred to as a "Notice of Privacy Practices." For specific rules on this notice please refer to 45 C.F.R. §164.520.

TR-1 (1)	G	G	G	GR	Low, Moderate, and High PII Confidentiality Impact Level Supplemental Guidance: Real-time notice facilitates informed consent and promotes trust from the individual when collecting sensitive PII. Real-time notice used in conjunction with a Privacy Act Statement or Privacy Advisory, based on the sensitivity of the PII provided or collected, ensures the individual provides informed consent. PHI Supplemental Guidance: The HIPAA Privacy Rule provides the option of layered notice to allow for simplified up-front notification with greater detail following. The Department of Health and Human Services has provided both guidance and model notices of privacy practices (see http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/modelnotices.html for details). PHI Regulatory/Statutory Reference: 45 C.F.R. §164.520
TR-2	+GR	+GR	+GR		Justification for Selection: SORNs and Privacy Act Statements, i.e., (e)(3) notices, provide transparency, in advance of collection, use, maintenance, or sharing of PII when in a system that meets the statutory definition of a "system of records" under the Privacy Act. The Privacy Act defines "maintain" as "maintain, collect, use or disseminate." These requirements impact decisions made during planning, design, development, and operation of programs and systems. Low, Moderate, and High PII Confidentiality Impact Level Supplemental Guidance: The Privacy Act and OMB guidance set forth specific requirements regarding when and how notices are provided. In addition to any internal organization review process, the publication of a SORN in the Federal Register requires a mandatory review and comment period of a minimum of 40 days. Regarding TR-2, paragraph a, the publication of a SORN is required only when the PII is maintained in a system that meets the statutory definition of a "system of records" under the Privacy Act. Not all systems containing PII may meet the definition of a "system of records." However, all PII maintained by an organization must be protected irrespective of whether the PII is subject to the Privacy Act. Regarding TR-2, paragraph c, the PAS, when required, should be provided in the same format as the information is collected. For example, an electronic statement on a website, a written statement on a paper form, and a verbal statement provided for information that is collected verbally. Low, Moderate, and High PII Confidentiality Impact Level Regulatory/Statutory Reference: 5 U.S.C. §552a(e)(3)-(e)(4)
TR-2 (1)	+GR	+GR	+GR		Justification for Selection: Publishing SORNs on organization websites improves transparency by providing individuals easier access to information about how their PII will be collected, used, maintained, or shared; and centralizing the information regarding to whom an individual should submit a request for access or amendment to their information covered by the SORN. Low, Moderate, and High PII Confidentiality Impact Level Supplemental Guidance: The organization may establish a centralized website for publication of their SORNs.

TR-3	+R	+R	+R		Justification for Selection: Making information about an organization's privacy program readily available to the public reduces the burden on individuals wanting to better understand an organization's privacy practices; and reduces burden on privacy offices and program officials by providing answers to common privacy questions through an easily accessible forum.

UL-1	+EGR	+EGR	+EGR	+R	Justification for Selection: Consistent with the Privacy Act, the organization's internal use of PII contained in a SORN is limited to the purposes identified in one of the 12 exceptions to Section b of the Privacy Act and as described in the SORN. Consistent with the FIPPs and Section 208 of the E-Government Act, the organization's internal use of PII not contained in a SORN should be compatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected and as described in the PIA or other public notice. Low, Moderate, and High PII Confidentiality Impact Level Control Extension: All PII must be used for an official government purpose only. The officers and employees of the organization must have a need for the PII in the performance of their official duties. These requirements apply to all PII regardless of its coverage by the Privacy Act.

UL-2	+EGR	+EGR	+EGR	+GR	Justification for Selection: Sharing PII with third parties introduces new risks to the individual which, as applicable, requires organizations to establish formal agreements with the third party and ensure the sharing is compatible with the purposes described in notice to, and consent from, the individual. Consideration of privacy risks for sharing PII apply regardless of the method used or whether the information remains stored in the system of records. Data removed from an information system covered by a system of records notice (e.g., an HR database) and shared in another format (e.g., an Excel spreadsheet) must still meet purpose and use requirements of the associated notice. PII not in a system of records that is shared with a third party still must meet the Purpose Specification and, relatedly, Use Limitation FIPPs. For example, data extracts of PII shared via an Excel spreadsheet or database archive. Low, Moderate, and High PII Confidentiality Impact Level Control Extension: Consistent with the Purpose Specification and Use Limitation FIPPs, sharing of PII must be compatible with the purpose for which it was collected. Consistent with the Transparency FIPP, any subsequent sharing that is not compatible may not be done until additional notice is provided to the individual, their consent is obtained, and relevant documents are updated or published; e.g., when applicable and appropriate publish an updated SORN to cover the additional incompatible sharing and obtain consent from the affected individuals. Low, Moderate, and High PII Confidentiality Impact Level Supplemental Guidance: The reference in Appendix J, UL-2, to "ISE Privacy Guidelines," is to the Information Sharing Environment (ISE) established by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA). In accordance with Section 1016(d) of the IRTPA and in furtherance of Executive Order 13388, "Further Strengthening the Sharing of Terrorism Information to Protect Americans," the President of the United States approved for issuance and implementation the Information Sharing Environment Privacy Guidelines. In accordance with IRTPA, as recently amended by the 9/11 Commission Act enacted on August 3, 2007 (Pub. L. No. 110-53), the ISE facilitates the sharing of "terrorism information" and "homeland security information," as defined, respectively, in Section 1016(a)(5) of the IRTPA and Section 892(f)(1) of the Homeland Security Act (Pub. L. No. 107–296). The ISE Privacy Guidelines provide a framework to enable information sharing while protecting privacy, civil liberties, and other legal rights. PHI Supplemental Guidance: Under the HIPAA, a covered entity may not use, disclose or request a medical record, except when the medical record is specifically justified as the amount that is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of the use, disclosure, or request. The disclosure and sharing of PHI is governed by the HIPAA regulations. For details consult the HIPAA Privacy and Security rules at http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/index.html.
